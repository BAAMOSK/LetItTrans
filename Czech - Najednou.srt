00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,
Na vrcholchích v noci panuje sníh,
The snow rules on the hilltops at night,

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
not a footprint to be seen
ani stopa po lidech
not a footprint to be seen

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,500
A kingdom of isolation,
Ta samota království vňmž,
The loneliness of the kingdom in which

00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
and it looks like I'm the queen
královnou jsem vloček všech
I am the queen of all the snowflakes

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Už kvílí vítr a hřmí bouře v srdci mém
The wind is howling and the storm is thundering in my heart

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,000
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried
Zlobu vyšeptám v tichu mrazivém
I'll whisper out my anger in the chilling silence

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Já byla v zámku vězněná
I was trapped in a castle

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,500
Be the good girl you always had to be
skrývej city, bud' skříňka zamčená
hide your feelings, be a locked box

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
To táta chtěl, ty dny pryč jsou
That's what my dad wanted, those days are gone

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, now they know!
Svět zná tvář mou!
The world knows my face!

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let it go, let it go!
Najednou, najednou!
Suddenly, suddenly!

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Can't hold it back any more!
chci skončit s tou hloupou hrou
I want to end the stupid game

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Let it go, let it go!
Najednou, najednou!
Suddenly, suddenly!

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,000
Turn away and slam the door!
dveřmi prásknu za sebou
I'll slam the door behind myself

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,500
I don't care what they're going to say
Já jsem svá, to chci dokázat všem
I'm myself, I want to prove that to everyone

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,000
Let the storm rage on
V bouři rozkvétám
I'm blooming in the storm

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The cold never bothered me anyway.
A mráz v duši víězí nad sluncem.
And the cold in my soul wins over the sun.

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,500
It's funny how some distance
Je zvláštní jak z té dálky,
It's funny how from the distance,

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,000
Makes everything seem small
se všechno menší zdá
everything seems smaller

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,000
And the fears that once controlled me
I ten strach co ve mně vládnul
Even the fear that once controlled me

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Can't get to me at all!
je loutka bezmocná!
is a helpless puppet!

00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,000
It's time to see what I can do
Jen vyzkouším, jak mocná jsem
I'll just try how powerful I am

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,500
To test the limits and break through
A k výšinám mě zvedne zem
And the ground will raise me to heights

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,500
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
V své říši bez konce chci žít
I want to live forever in my kingdom

00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
I'm free!
klid mít!
in peace!

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,500
Let it go, let it go!
Najednou, najednou!
Suddenly, suddenly!

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
I am one with the wind and sky
volná jsem, kráčím oblohou
I am free, I'm walking through the sky

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,000
Let it go, let it go!
Najednou, najednou!
Suddenly, suddenly!

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You'll never see me cry
mé slzy šperkem jsou
my tears are my jewelry

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,500
Here I stand, and here I'll stay,
Já jsem svá, jsem hráč i rváč
I'm myself, I'm both the player and the fighter

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,000
Let the storm rage on...
V bouři rozkvétám...
I'm blooming in the storm...

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,000
My power flurries through the air and to the ground
Moc má se vzduchem vznáší v proudu neznámém
My power is floating through the air in an unknown flow

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:46,000
My soul is spiralling in frozen fractals all around
A chladná duše září v krystalcích jak diadém
And the cold soul is shining in the crystals like a tiara

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,000
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
Mé myšlenky se tříští, jedna smysl má
My thoughts are fragmented, only one makes sense

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I'm never going back
Je pasé minulost,
The past is passé,

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,500
The past is in the past!
když svítat začíná!
when it begins to dawn!

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Let it go, let it go!
Najednou, najednou!
Suddenly, suddenly!

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
úsvit dává mi sílu svou
the dawn is giving me its power

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,000
Let it go, let it go!
Najednou, najednou!
Suddenly, suddenly!

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,500
That perfect girl is gone
už nejsem dívenkou
I'm not a little girl any more

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,500
Here I stand in the light of day
Já jsem svá, křídla má hlas můj
I'm myself, my voice has wings

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,000
Let the storm rage on!
V bouři rozkvétám!
I'm blooming in the storm!

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,500
The cold never bothered me anyway.
Chci žít zimě bez konce život svůj.
I want to live my life in the endless winter.
