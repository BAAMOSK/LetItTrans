00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,
Sneg blešči se povsod nocoj
The snow glows everywhere tonight

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
not a footprint to be seen
In nobenih ni sledi
There are no footprints

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,500
A kingdom of isolation,
Osamljeno je kraljestvo
The kingdom is lonely

00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
and it looks like I'm the queen
In kraljica sama sem
And the queen is myself

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
In veter vpije, ko vrtinec v meni tli
And the wind is shouting, when a twister inside of me smolders

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,000
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried
Na ves glas kričim, v meni ne zdrži
I'm screaming out loud, it can't stay inside

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Skrij svoj obraz, obrni se drugam
Hide your face, turn around

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,500
Be the good girl you always had to be
Bodi takšna kot drugi so vsi
Be like everyone else

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Prijrij kar si, naj ne vedo
Hide what you are, don't let them know

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, now they know!
A zdaj vedo!
But now they know!

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let it go, let it go!
Zaživim, se pustim!
I come to life, I let go!

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Can't hold it back any more!
Ne morem več tja nazaj
I can't go back there

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Let it go, let it go!
Zaživim, se pustim!
I come to life, I let go!

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,000
Turn away and slam the door!
Ne obrnem več se stran
Won't turn away any more

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,500
I don't care what they're going to say
Naj vedo, zdaj pokažem kaj znam
Let them know, now I'll show them what I can do

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,000
Let the storm rage on
Kot nevihta sem
I am like a storm

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The cold never bothered me anyway.
Ker mraz vedno bil je moj pravi dom.
The cold was always my home.

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,500
It's funny how some distance
Tu zares sem srečna
I'm truly happy here

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,000
Makes everything seem small
Vse nepomembno je
Everything is unimportant

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,000
And the fears that once controlled me
In strahov več ni v meni
There are no fears inside of me any more

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Can't get to me at all!
Izginili so vsi!
They all disappeared!

00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,000
It's time to see what I can do
Zdaj naj pokažem vse kar znem
Now I shall show everything that I can do

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,500
To test the limits and break through
Prestrežem meje grem naprej
I break the limits, I go on

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,500
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
Tu ni napak in ne pravil
There's no mistakes or rules here

00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
I'm free!
Letim!
I'm flying!

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,500
Let it go, let it go!
Zaživim, se pustim!
I come to life, I let go!

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
I am one with the wind and sky
Kot eno z vetrom do neba
I'm one with the wind to the sky

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,000
Let it go, let it go!
Zaživim, se pustim!
I come to life, I let go!

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You'll never see me cry
Jokala več ne bom
I will never cry

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,500
Here I stand, and here I'll stay,
Tu stojim, in stala bom
Here I stand, and here I'll stand

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,000
Let the storm rage on...
Kot nevihta sem...
I am like a storm...

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,000
My power flurries through the air and to the ground
Vsa moja moč vrti iz zraka se v tla
All my power spirals from the air into the ground

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:46,000
My soul is spiralling in frozen fractals all around
In duša zlahka nosi hladne delce do neba
And my soul can easily carry cold parts to the sky

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,000
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
Vse misli kot kristali z vetrom se vrte
All thoughts are spiraling like crystals in the wind

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I'm never going back
Ne vrnem se nazaj
I'm not going back

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,500
The past is in the past!
Preteklost dalje gre!
The past moves on!

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Let it go, let it go!
Zaživim, se pustim!
I come to life, I let go!

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Kakor sonce v zori žarim
I glow like the sun in dawn

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,000
Let it go, let it go!
Zaživim, se pustim!
I come to life, I let go!

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,500
That perfect girl is gone
Popolna se zbudim
I wake up perfect

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,500
Here I stand in the light of day
Tu stojim, bela luč sveta
I stand here, the white light of the world

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,000
Let the storm rage on!
Kot nevihta pa!
Like a storm!

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,500
The cold never bothered me anyway.
Ker mraz vedno bil je moj pravi dom.
The cold was always my home.
