Disney's "Frozen" has a rather awesome song in it, which you just might have
heard of... "Let it go". There are 44 official translations, and I'd like to
compile a collection of translations from each one back to English. Since I
don't speak all these languages, that means asking the internet for help!

The original words are owned by Disney. The translations back are written by
various people from around the internet; see the individual files or check
here for credits. Ideally, I would like contributions to be licensed under a
Creative Commons attribution/share-alike license (CC-BY-SA 3.0); all my own
work in this project is so licensed.
