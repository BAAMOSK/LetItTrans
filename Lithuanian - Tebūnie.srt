00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,
Ant kalno šiąnakt spindi sniegas baltai,
Tonight on the mountain the snow shines white,

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
not a footprint to be seen
Pėdsako nėr, nematyt
Not a footprint to be seen

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,500
A kingdom of isolation,
Vieniša karalystė,
The desolated kingdom,

00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
and it looks like I'm the queen
Ir turiu aš ja valdyt
And I have to rule it

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Ledinis vėjas kaukia, siaučia viduje
Frosty wind is howling, storming inside

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,000
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried
Kaip man išlaikyt siunkią naštą šią
How should I live through this heavy burden?

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Daugiau neleisk jiems pamatyt
Don't let them see any more

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,500
Be the good girl you always had to be
Būk gerutė, tik visada mergyt
Be good, like always, girl

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Neleisk suprast, paslėpk, nejausk
Don't let them know, conceal, don't feel

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, now they know!
Bet jau vėlu!
But now it's too late!

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let it go, let it go!
Tebūnie, tebūnie!
Let it be, let it be!

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Can't hold it back any more!
Laikytis neprivalau
I don't have to follow

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Let it go, let it go!
Tebūnie, tebūnie!
Let it be, let it be!

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,000
Turn away and slam the door!
Nusigręžti man lengviau!
Turning away is easier for me!

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,500
I don't care what they're going to say
Man vis vien, Ką galvoja jie
What they think, doesn't matter to me

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,000
Let the storm rage on
Laikas siaust pūga
It's time to lark around like a snowstorm

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The cold never bothered me anyway.
Mano širdy vis šalta žiema.
And the cold winter is still in my heart.

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,500
It's funny how some distance
Kaip keista iš aukštybių,
It's strange, from above,

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,000
Makes everything seem small
Visus mažus matau
I see everyone small

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,000
And the fears that once controlled me
Ir kadais užvaldę baimės,
And the fears that once overtook me

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Can't get to me at all!
Manes nebepagaus!
Won't grip me!

00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,000
It's time to see what I can do
Suprasti metas, kągaliu,
It's time to know what I can do,

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,500
To test the limits and break through
Surast ribas, nepaisyt jų
To find the limits, (and) defy them

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,500
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
Jokių taisyklių šiam kely
In this path there are no rules

00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
I'm free!
Aš laisva!
I'm free!

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,500
Let it go, let it go!
Tebūnie, tebūnie!
Let it be, let it be!

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
I am one with the wind and sky
Su dangum ir vėju, aš viena
I'm one with the wind and sky

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,000
Let it go, let it go!
Tebūnie, tebūnie!
Let it be, let it be!

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You'll never see me cry
Neverksiu niekada
I won't ever cry

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,500
Here I stand, and here I'll stay,
ši dieną - manu sukurta
This day is created by me

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,000
Let the storm rage on...
Lai te siaus pūga...
It's time to lark around like a snowstorm...

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,000
My power flurries through the air and to the ground
Lai šaltis valdo visą žemę šiam kalne
Let the frost rule the ground on this mountain

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:46,000
My soul is spiralling in frozen fractals all around
Sušalus mano siela šalto ledo kristale
Frozen soul of mine in a cold crystal of ice

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,000
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
Didžiai pas tave yra mintis labai aiški
Great is your bright idea

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I'm never going back
Negrįšiu aš atgal,
I won't go back,

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,500
The past is in the past!
Kas liko - praeity!
What's left is in the past!

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Let it go, let it go!
Tebūnie, tebūnie!
Let it be, let it be!

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Ir aš kylu su ryškia aušra
And I'm arising with a bright dawn

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,000
Let it go, let it go!
Tebūnie, tebūnie!
Let it be, let it be!

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,500
That perfect girl is gone
Nebūsiu aš gera
I won't be good as gold

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,500
Here I stand in the light of day
Pagaliau, aš viršūnėje
At least, I'm at the top

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,000
Let the storm rage on!
Lai te siaus pūga!
It's time to lark around like a snowstorm!

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,500
The cold never bothered me anyway.
O mano širdy vis šalta žiema.
And the cold winter is still in my heart.
