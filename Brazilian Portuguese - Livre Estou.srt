00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,
A neve branca brilhando no chão
The white snow shining on the ground

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
not a footprint to be seen
Sem pegadas pra seguir
There's no footprint to follow

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,500
A kingdom of isolation,
Um reino de isolamento
A kingdom of isolation

00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
and it looks like I'm the queen
E a Rainha está aqui
And the Queen is here

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
A tempestade vem chegando e já não sei
The storm is coming and I don't know anymore

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,000
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried
Não consegui contar, bem que eu tentei
I couldn't contain it, as much as I tried

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Não podem vir, não podem ver
They cannot come, they cannot see

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,500
Be the good girl you always had to be
Sempre a boa menina deve ser
Always the good girl, you must be

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Encobrir, não sentir, nunca saberão
Cover up, do not feel, they will never know

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, now they know!
Mas agora vão!
But now they will!

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let it go, let it go!
Livre estou, livre estou!
I am free, I am free!

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Can't hold it back any more!
Não posso mais segurar
Can't hold it back any more

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Let it go, let it go!
Livre estou, livre estou!
I am free! I am free!

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,000
Turn away and slam the door!
Eu saí pra não voltar
I left not to go back

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,500
I don't care what they're going to say
Não me importa o que vão falar
What they're going to say doesn't matter to me

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,000
Let the storm rage on
Tempestade vem
Come the storm

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The cold never bothered me anyway.
O frio não vai mesmo me incomodar.
The cold won't bother me anyway.

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,500
It's funny how some distance
De longe tudo muda,
From far everything changes,

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,000
Makes everything seem small
parace ser bem menor
it seems to be much smaller

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,000
And the fears that once controlled me
Os medos que me controlavam,
I do not see around me

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Can't get to me at all!
não vejo ao meu redor
the fears that controlled me

00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,000
It's time to see what I can do
É hora de experimentar
It's time to experiment

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,500
To test the limits and break through
Os meus limites vou testar
My limits I will test

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,500
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
A liberdade veio enfim
Freedom has come at last

00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
I'm free!
Pra mim
For me

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,500
Let it go, let it go!
Livre estou, livre estou!
I am free, I am free!

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
I am one with the wind and sky
Com o céu e o vento andar
To walk with the sky and the wind

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,000
Let it go, let it go!
Livre estou, livre estou!
I am free, I am free!

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You'll never see me cry
Não vão me ver chorar
They won't see me cry

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,500
Here I stand, and here I'll stay,
Aqui estou eu, e vou ficar
Here am I, and I will stay

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,000
Let the storm rage on...
Tempestade vem...
Come the storm...

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,000
My power flurries through the air and to the ground
O meu poder envolve o ar e vai ao chão
My power envelops the air and goes to the ground

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:46,000
My soul is spiralling in frozen fractals all around
Da minha alma fluem fractais de gelo em profusão
Ice fractals flow in profusion from my soul

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,000
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
Um pensamento se transforma em cristais
A thought turns into crystals

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I'm never going back
Não vou me arrepender...
I will not regret...

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,500
The past is in the past!
... do que ficou pra trás!
... what has been left behind!

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Let it go, let it go!
Livre estou, livre estou!
I am free, I am free!

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Como o sol vou me levantar
Like the sun, I will rise

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,000
Let it go, let it go!
Livre estou, livre estou!
I am free, I am free!

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,500
That perfect girl is gone
É tempo de mudar
It's time to change

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,500
Here I stand in the light of day
Aqui estou eu, vendo a luz brilhar
Here am I, seeing the light shine

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,000
Let the storm rage on!
Tempestade vem!
Come the storm!

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,500
The cold never bothered me anyway.
O frio não vai mesmo me incomodar.
The cold won't bother me anyway.
