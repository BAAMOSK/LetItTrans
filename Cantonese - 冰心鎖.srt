00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,
寒風冰山將心窩都冷凍
hon fung bing saan zeng sam wo dou laang dung
The cold winds and icy mountains freeze my heart

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
not a footprint to be seen
冰山冰鋒　彷似夢
bing saan bing fung fong ci mung
These icy peaks seem like a dream

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,500
A kingdom of isolation,
就像墜落在世界外
zau zeng do lok zoi sai gaai ngoi
It feels like I've fallen out of this world,

00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
and it looks like I'm the queen
放眼雪山　一片空
fong ngaan syut saan yat pin hung
As I look around and see nothing but emptiness

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
陣陣冷風撲面刺痛天際亂碰
zan zan laang fung pok min ci tung tin zai lyun pung
My face is stung by the cold winds as they blow across the sky

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,000
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried
此刻心更慌　驚慌擾惡夢
ci hak sam gang fong ging fong yiu ok mung
Now my heart panics even more, which disturbs this bad dream

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Don't let them in, don't let them see
誰曾勸我　逃離心魔
sui cang hyun ngo tou lei sam mo
I've been told that to escape from my inner demons,

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,500
Be the good girl you always had to be
不惹紛爭　唯憑善意輔助
bat ye fan zang wai pang sin yi fu zo
Don't attract trouble by relying on others for help

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
埋藏以往　遺忘當初
maai cong yi wong wai mong dong co
Bury the past, forget the start,

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, now they know!
遺忘自我

Forget myself!

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let it go, let it go!
忘掉那　無形鎖

Forget that invisible lock

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Can't hold it back any more!
我才能完全是我

I'll finally be able to be myself

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Let it go, let it go!
誰亦要　隨心歌
sui yik yiu cui sam go
Who else wants to follow their heart?

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,000
Turn away and slam the door!
誰願陷落於心鎖
sui yun ham lok yu sam so
Who'd want to fall into their heart's lock?

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,500
I don't care what they're going to say
不必躲　旁人休得管我
bat bit do pong yan yau dak gun ngo
There's no need to hide from those that try to control me

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,000
Let the storm rage on
我拒絕諧和

I refuse to let things be

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The cold never bothered me anyway.

zi seon laang huk yaa mei bit seng dou ngo
I'm confident the cold can't hurt me

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,500

當初驚天的一切

All the things that I once feared,

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,000
Makes everything seem small
如今都變爛泥

Have all been turned to slush

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,000
And the fears that once controlled me
繁文共律例也失去
faan man gung leot lai yaa sat hui
Those complicated rules and regulations have lost

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Can't get to me at all!
往昔一般天威
wong sik yat bun tin wai
the power they once had!

00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,000
It's time to see what I can do
回頭看我如何發揮
wui tau hon ngo yu ho faat fai
Look back and see what I can do,

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,500
To test the limits and break through
似衝破法規與天齊
ci cung po faat kwai yu tin cai
Break the rules and break through to the sky

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,500
No right, no wrong, no rules for me

Nothing is off-limits, forget those rules

00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500

忘掉那　無形鎖

Whereever I go, I will proudly be myself

I use my powers to perform a song praising the icy skies

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:46,000
My soul is spiralling in frozen fractals all around
我內裡藏著潛力翻出不世的風波

I have the potential inside of me to create an everlasting storm

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,000

Watch as the path ahead of me is frozen for miles and miles

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500

As I head towards a new day,

The past is in the past!

I won't be held back any more!

放棄吧　無形鎖

Give up that invisible lock

And I'll rise like the break of dawn
再度黎明重頭活過

When dawn breaks, a new life awaits
