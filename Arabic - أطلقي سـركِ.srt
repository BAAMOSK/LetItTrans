00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,
الثلج الليلة كالصحراء
Ath'thalju al'laya'ta kas'sahra'
The snow tonight is a sand desert

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
not a footprint to be seen
لم تلمسه اقدام
lam talmas'hu aqdam
that hasn't been touched by feet

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,500
A kingdom of isolation,
مملكة للحيارى
Mamlaka'tun lil'hayara
A kingdom for the bewildered

00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
and it looks like I'm the queen
أحكمها بسلام
ahkumu'ha bi'salam
that I rule in peace

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
الريح تعوي مثل العاصفة داخلي
Ar'rihu ta'wi mithla al'asifati dakhili
The wind is howling like a storm inside me

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,000
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried
كيف تختفي؟ حاولت جاهدة
Kayfa takhtafi? Hawaltu jahida
How to make it go? I tried hard

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Don't let them in, don't let them see
لا تكشفي سر الجليد
La takshifi sir al'jaleed
Don't disclose the secret of the snow

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,500
Be the good girl you always had to be
كوني كما شعبك يريد
Kuni kama sha'buki yureed
Be what your people want you to be

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
تخفىي الإحساس . كى يجهلوا
Tukhfi al'ehsas kay yajhalu
The girl who conceals her feelings so they don't know

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, now they know!
قد عرفوا
Qad a'rafu!
But [now] they know!

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let it go, let it go!
اطلقي سرك
Atliqi sirraki
Make your secret known

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Can't hold it back any more!
لن أتحمل العذاب
Lan ata'hammal al'athab
I won't take the agony any more

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Let it go, let it go!

Atliqi sirraki
Make your secret known

Turn away and slam the door!
اغلقي خلفك الابواب
Aghliqi khalfaki al'abwab
Close the doors behind you

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,500
I don't care what they're going to say
لا اخشى كل ما سيقال
La akh'sha kulluama sa'yuqal
I don't fear all what will be said

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,000
Let the storm rage on
اطلقي العنا ن
Atliqi al'anan!
Go ahead, unleash!

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The cold never bothered me anyway.
الثلج لا يشعرني باكتئاب
Ath'thalju la yush'e'runi bikti'ab
Snow does not depress me

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,500
It's funny how some distance
المشكلات ستصغر
Al'mushkilatu satas'ghur
The problem will get smaller

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,000
Makes everything seem small
لو نراها من بعيد
Law naraha min ba'eed
If we see it from far away

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,000
And the fears that once controlled me
والخوف الذى تملكني
Wa al'khawf al'lathi tamallakani...
And the fear that took over me...

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Can't get to me at all!
لم يعد منه مزيد
... lam ya'ud min'hu mazeed!
... there is no more of it!

00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,000
It's time to see what I can do
قد حان الوقت لانتصارات
Qad han al'waqtu lin'tisarat
The time has come for victories

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,500
To test the limits and break through
كى اختبر كل القدرات
Kay akhtabira kul al'qudrat
To test all [my] capabilities

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,500
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
بلا حدود تمنعني
Bi'la ho'dudin tamna'o'ni
With no boundaries to limit me

00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
I'm free!
إمضي
Emdi!
Go ahead!

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,500
Let it go, let it go!
اطلقى سرك
Atliqi sirraki
Make your secret known

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
I am one with the wind and sky
توحدي مع الاكوان
Tawah'hadi ma'a al'akwan
Unite with the universes

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,000
Let it go, let it go!
اطلقى سرك
Atliqi sirraki
Make your secret known

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You'll never see me cry
لن ابكي بعد الآن
Lan abkiya ba'ad al'aan
I will no longer cry

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,500
Here I stand, and here I'll stay,
ارضي هنا . وبها سأبقى
Ardi huna, wa bi'ha sa'abqa
Here is my land, and on it, I shall stay

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,000
Let the storm rage on...
اطلقي العنان
Atliqi al'anan!
Go ahead, unleash!

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,000
My power flurries through the air and to the ground
فقوتي تسري من الهواء إلى الصخور
Fa'quwwati tasri min al'hawa'i e'la al'sukhur
My power flurries through the air into the rocks

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:46,000
My soul is spiralling in frozen fractals all around
و روحي كلولب ثلجى يلمع مثل النور
Wa ruhi ka'lawlabin thaljiyyin yal'ma'u mithl an'noor
And my soul is a snow spiral beaming in the light

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,000
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
وتتبلور فتكون قذيفة من جليد
Wa tata'balwaru, fa'takun qathifatan min jaleed
Then it crystallizes, so it becomes a blast of ice

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I'm never going back
انا حتمنا لن اعود
Ana hatman lan a'oud
I will definitely not go back

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,500
The past is in the past!
الماضي, بيدأ صار!
Al'madi ba'eidan sar!
The past has become far!

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Let it go, let it go!
لن يعود . لن يعود
Lan ya'oud! Lan ya'oud!
It won't come back! It won't come back!

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
وسأشرق مثل النور
Wa sa'ushriqu mithl an'noor
And I will shine like a flare of light

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,000
Let it go, let it go!
لن يعود . لن يعود
Lan ya'oud! Lan ya'oud!
It won't come back! It won't come back!

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,500
That perfect girl is gone
فقدت برائتي
Faqd'tu bara'a'ti
I lost my naiveness

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,500
Here I stand in the light of day
ها أنا الآن اقف أمام الناس
Ha ana al'aan, aqifu a'mam an'nas
Here I am now, standing in front of people

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,000
Let the storm rage on!
وسط الرياح
Wast ar'riyah
In the midst of the wind

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,500
The cold never bothered me anyway.
الثلج لا يشعرني بإكتئاب
Ath'thalju la yush'e'runi bikti'ab
Snow does not depress me
