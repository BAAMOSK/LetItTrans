00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,
Pırıldıyor kar taneleri
The snowflakes are shining

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
not a footprint to be seen
bütun izler silinmis
all the remains were wiped away

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,500
A kingdom of isolation,
Bir soyutlanma krallığı
A kingdom of isolation

00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
and it looks like I'm the queen
bense sanki prensesi
and I'm its princess

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Rüzgar uluyor coşan fırtına gibi
The wind is howling like the gushing storm

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,000
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried
Durduramadım, oysa denedim
I couldn't stop it, however I tried

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Aman sakla görmesinler
Oh, hide it. Don't let them see.

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,500
Be the good girl you always had to be
Seni iyi birisi sansınlar
Make them think you're a good person

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Ört hisleri, bilmesinler
Cover the feelings, don't let them know

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, now they know!
Biliyorlar!
They know!

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let it go, let it go!
Aldırma, aldırma!
Don't mind, don't mind!

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Can't hold it back any more!
Engel olamıyorum
I cannot prevent it

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Let it go, let it go!
Aldırma, aldırma!
Don't mind, don't mind!

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,000
Turn away and slam the door!
Uzaklaşmak istiyorum
I want to wander away

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,500
I don't care what they're going to say
Fark etmez varsın konoşsunlar
It doesn't matter, let them talk

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,000
Let the storm rage on
Sürsün fırtına
Let the storm keep on

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The cold never bothered me anyway.
Soğuk neyse, beni hiç üzmedi.
Whatever the cold is, didn't ever make me sad.

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,500
It's funny how some distance
Biraz uzaktan cisimler
The objects from a bit far

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,000
Makes everything seem small
Küçük görünürler
seem small

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,000
And the fears that once controlled me
Beni yöneten korkular
The fears which did control me

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Can't get to me at all!
Bana erişemezler!
Cannot reach me!

00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,000
It's time to see what I can do
Gücümü deneme vakti
It's time to try my power

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,500
To test the limits and break through
Sınırları, gelişmeyi
To try the limits, to thrive

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,500
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
Doğru yanliş bir kural yok
There's no true-false rule

00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
I'm free!
Özgür!
Free!

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,500
Let it go, let it go!
Aldırma, aldırma!
Don't mind, don't mind!

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
I am one with the wind and sky
Rüzgarın ve göğün yanında
Nearby the wind and sky

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,000
Let it go, let it go!
Aldırma, aldırma!
Don't mind, don't mind!

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You'll never see me cry
Ağlamayacağım asla
I am never going to cry

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,500
Here I stand, and here I'll stay,
Burdayım, yaşam burda
I am here, the lifetime is here

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,000
Let the storm rage on...
Sürsün fırtına...
Let the storm keep on...

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,000
My power flurries through the air and to the ground
Gücüm toprağı sel gibi kaplamakta
My power is covering the earth like the flood

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:46,000
My soul is spiralling in frozen fractals all around
Ruhum daireler çiziyor değişken yapıda
My soul is drawing circles in the changing structure

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,000
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
Bir düşüncem bile her yeri dondurur
Even my one thought freezes everywhere

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I'm never going back
Geri dönmem asla
I am never going back

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,500
The past is in the past!
Geçmiş çok uzakta!
The past is so far away!

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Let it go, let it go!
Aldırma, aldırma!
Don't mind, don't mind!

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Ruhum yeniden doğmakta
My soul is reborn

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,000
Let it go, let it go!
Aldırma, aldırma!
Don't mind, don't mind!

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,500
That perfect girl is gone
Kusursuz kız yok burda
There is no flawless girl

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,500
Here I stand in the light of day
Burdayım ben karşınızda
I am here, I am in front of you

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,000
Let the storm rage on!
Sürsün fırtına!
Let the storm keep on!

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,500
The cold never bothered me anyway.
Soğuk neyse, beni hiç üzmedi.
Whatever the cold is, didn't ever make me sad.
