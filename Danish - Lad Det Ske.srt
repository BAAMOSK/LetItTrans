00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,
Den glitrende sne dækker bjerget i nat,
The sparkling snow covers the mountain tonight,

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
not a footprint to be seen
ingen fodspor viser vej
no footprints show the way

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,500
A kingdom of isolation,
Et helt isoleret rige,
An entirely isolated kingdom,

00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
and it looks like I'm the queen
og dets dronning, det er mig
and its Queen, that's me

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Og vindens tuden spejler stormen indeni
And the cry of the wind reflects the storm inside

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,000
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried
Jag har mistet alt til en ond magi
I have lost everything to an evil magic

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Luk ingen ind, lad ingen se
Let nobody in, let nobody see

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,500
Be the good girl you always had to be
Hold facaden, det' du forpligtet til
Keep up the facade, that's what you're obligated to do

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Luk af hver dag, lig låget på
Shut off every day, put on the lid

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, now they know!
Nu skal de få!
I'll show them now!

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let it go, let it go!
Lad det ske, lad dem se!
Let it happen, let them see!

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Can't hold it back any more!
Jeg viser mig som jeg er
I show myself as I am

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Let it go, let it go!
Lad det ske, lad dem se!
Let it happen, let them see!

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,000
Turn away and slam the door!
Jeg vil aldrig gemme mig mere
I will never hide any more

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,500
I don't care what they're going to say
Aldrig mere vil jeg lytte til dem
Never again will I listen to them

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,000
Let the storm rage on
Ja, det stormer, men -
Yes, it's storming, but -

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The cold never bothered me anyway.
det iskolde fjeld er mit sande hjem.
the ice cold mountain is my true home.

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,500
It's funny how some distance
Når man er lid på afstand,
When you have some distance,

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,000
Makes everything seem small
bli'r alle ting så små
everything gets so small

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,000
And the fears that once controlled me
Og mit liv i frygtens lænker
And my life in the chains of fear

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Can't get to me at all!
er slut, må de forstå
is over, must they understand

00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,000
It's time to see what I can do
Det bli'r mit store gennembrud
It'll be my big breakthrough

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,500
To test the limits and break through
Nu gi'r jeg los, går linen ud
I'll give everything I have now, walk out the line

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,500
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
Farvel til pligtens tyrrani
Goodby to duty's tyranny

00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
I'm free!
jeg' fri!
I'm free!

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,500
Let it go, let it go!
Lad det ske, lad dem se!
Let it happen, let them see!

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
I am one with the wind and sky
De kræfter som jeg har fået
Those powers that I have been giving

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,000
Let it go, let it go!
Lad det ske, det' forbi!
Let it happen, it's over!

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You'll never see me cry
Med skam og bitter gråd
With shame and bitter crying

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,500
Here I stand, and here I'll stay,
Når jeg bli'r til den jeg er
When I become the one I am

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,000
Let the storm rage on...
bryder stormen løs
the storm will break loose

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,000
My power flurries through the air and to the ground
Jeg ryster jord og himmel let som ingenting
I shake the ground and sky as easily as nothing

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:46,000
My soul is spiralling in frozen fractals all around
Isblomster springer ud og samles i en sluttet ring
Ice flowers bloom and assemble in a connected circle

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,000
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
Og som krystaller står en tanke ganske klar
And just like crystals, a thought appears so clear

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I'm never going back
Kan aldrig vende hjem,
Can never return back home,

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,500
The past is in the past!
farvel til det der var!
goodbye to all that was!

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Let it go, let it go!
Lad det ske, lad dem se!
Let it happen, let them see!

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Nu er handskerne taget af
Now the gloves have been taken off

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,000
Let it go, let it go!
Is og sne vil I see
Ice and snow you will see

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,500
That perfect girl is gone
Jeg er klar til en helt ny dag
I'm ready for a whole new day

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,500
Here I stand in the light of day
Og med ét bryder lyset frem
And suddenly the light breaks out

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,000
Let the storm rage on!
Vinterstorm, kom an!
Winterstorm, bring it!

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,500
The cold never bothered me anyway.
Det iskolde fjeld er mit sande hjem.
The ice cold mountain is my true home.
