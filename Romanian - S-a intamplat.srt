00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,
Zăpada strălucește-n amurg,
The snow glows in the twilight,

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
not a footprint to be seen
Nici-o urmă nu-i pe ea
Not a footprint is on it

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,500
A kingdom of isolation,
Tărâmul ascuns de lume,
The land hidden from the world,

00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
and it looks like I'm the queen
Este-mpărăția mea
Is my kingdom

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Aici e totul ca furtuna ce-o trăiesc
Here everything is like the storm that I live in

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,000
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried
Știu c-am încercat, nu pot s-o opresc
I know I've tried, I can't stop it

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Nu te-arăta, nu îi primi,
Don't show yourself, don't let them in,

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,500
Be the good girl you always had to be
Fata bună tu trebuie să fii!
A good girl you need to be!

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Zăvorul tras și încuiat
A pulled and locked latch

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, now they know!
Dar au aflat!
But now they know!

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let it go, let it go!
S-a-ntâmplat, s-a-ntâmplat!
It happened, it happened!

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Can't hold it back any more!
Eu nu am mai rezistat!
I couldn't resist any more!

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Let it go, let it go!
S-a-ntâmplat, s-a-ntâmplat!
It happened, it happened!

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,000
Turn away and slam the door!
Pe un alt drum am plecat!
On another way I went!

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,500
I don't care what they're going to say
Ce spun toți, nu e treaba mea!
What they all say, isn't my business!

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,000
Let the storm rage on
Fie ger mereu!
It can always be frost!

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The cold never bothered me anyway.
De azi gerul e prietenul meu!
From today the frost is my friend!

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,500
It's funny how some distance
Ciudat cum total pare
Strange how everything seems

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,000
Makes everything seem small
Departe și uitat
Far away and forgotten

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,000
And the fears that once controlled me
Și cum temerile mele
And how my fears

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Can't get to me at all!
De-odată au încetat!
Suddenly ceased!

00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,000
It's time to see what I can do
E timpul meu să mă pornesc
It's my time to start myself (?)

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,500
To test the limits and break through
Să văd ce pot, ce reușesc
To see what I can do, what I can accomplish

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,500
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
Să fie numai cum vreau eu,
To only be how I want it,

00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
I'm free!
Mereu!
Always!

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,500
Let it go, let it go!
S-a-ntâmplat, s-a-ntâmplat!
It happened, it happened!

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
I am one with the wind and sky
Sunt vântul stârnit din cer!
I'm the wind arisen from the sky!

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,000
Let it go, let it go!
S-a-ntâmplat, s-a-ntâmplat!
It happened, it happened!

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You'll never see me cry
Și lacrimile-mi pier!
And my tears fade away!

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,500
Here I stand, and here I'll stay,
Liberă, aici în ger!
Free, here in the frost!

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,000
Let the storm rage on...
Vântul să-l pornesc...
I'll start the frost...

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,000
My power flurries through the air and to the ground
Puterea mea domnește în cer și pe Pământ!
My power reigns in the sky and on Earth!

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:46,000
My soul is spiralling in frozen fractals all around
Și sufletul-mi roiește peste crestele de-argint
And my soul swarms over the silver crests

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,000
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
Un jurământ puternic azi am de făcut:
A strong oath I have to make today:

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I'm never going back
Eu nu mă mai întorc,
I won't go back,

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,500
The past is in the past!
Trecutul e trecut!
The past is in the past!

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Let it go, let it go!
S-a-ntâmplat, s-a-ntâmplat!
It happened, it happened!

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Ca din somn eu m-am deșteptat!
Like from sleep I've woken up!

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,000
Let it go, let it go!
S-a-ntâmplat, s-a-ntâmplat!
It happened, it happened!

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,500
That perfect girl is gone
Și-n viață am plecat!
And in life I go!

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,500
Here I stand in the light of day
Stau aici, liberă mereu!
Here I stay, always free!

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,000
Let the storm rage on!
Vântul să-l pornesc!
I'll start the frost!

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,500
The cold never bothered me anyway.
De azi gerul e prietenul meu.
From today the frost is my friend.
