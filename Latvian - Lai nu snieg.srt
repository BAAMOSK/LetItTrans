00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,
Te kalnus ieskauj baltais sniegs
Mountains are covered in white snow

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
not a footprint to be seen
Un tas pārklāj nogāzes
And it covers slopes

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,500
A kingdom of isolation,
Šī karaļvalsts visa ledū
This kingdom is covered in ice

00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
and it looks like I'm the queen
Kurā diemžēl - valdu es
In which, unfortunately, I rule

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Pūš spēcīgs vējš un mani augstas bēdas māc
Wind is blowing and high feelings of grief are mocking me

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,000
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried
Nevar noslēp to, Man tas nesanāk
I can't hide it, I can't do it

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Tik nebaidies un savaldies
Don't be afraid and restrain

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,500
Be the good girl you always had to be
Smaidi vienmēr, tu vari priecāties
Always smile, you can rejoice

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Slēpies, centies, tev jāslēpj to
Hide, try it, you have to hide it

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, now they know!
Kas tev ir dots
What you are given

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let it go, let it go!
Lai nu snieg, Lai nu snieg!
Let it snow, Let it snow!

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Can't hold it back any more!
Vairs nespēju noslēpt to
I can't hide it anymore

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Let it go, let it go!
Lai nu snieg, Lai nu snieg!
Let it snow, Let it snow!

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,000
Turn away and slam the door!
Man nav vairs jātēlo
I don't have to pretend

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,500
I don't care what they're going to say
Prieks ir man, Bēdām pienāks gals
Happiness is in me, Sadness has to end

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,000
Let the storm rage on
Sniega vētra nāk
Snow storm is coming

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The cold never bothered me anyway.
Man sals ir paticis tik un tā
I liked cold better

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,500
It's funny how some distance
Es atradīšos citur
I will be somewhere else

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,000
Makes everything seem small
Mans sapnis mani sauc
My dream is calling me

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,000
And the fears that once controlled me
Un bailes kuras manī
And the fear that I had

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Can't get to me at all!
Nemaz vairs neuztrauc
Don't bother anymore

00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,000
It's time to see what I can do
Laiks pārbaudīt, Kas spēju kļūt
Time to test what I can become

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,500
To test the limits and break through
Šai vietā varu pati būt
In this place I can be myself

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,500
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
Lai valda miers, kas manī mīt
Let the peace rule, which lives in me

00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
I'm free!
Sniegs krīt
Snow is falling

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,500
Let it go, let it go!
Lai nu snieg, Lai nu snieg!
Let it snow, Let it snow!

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
I am one with the wind and sky
Man ir vējš šajās debesīs
I have wind in the sky

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,000
Let it go, let it go!
Lai nu snieg, Lai nu snieg!
Let it snow, Let it snow!

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You'll never see me cry
Vējš bēdas aizpūtīs
Wind will blow away all sadness

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,500
Here I stand, and here I'll stay,
Rīts ir klāt, Tas pieder man
Morning is here, it belongs to me

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,000
Let the storm rage on...
Sniega vētra nāk...
Snow storm is coming...

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,000
My power flurries through the air and to the ground
Mans spēks skar debesis un arī zemi skauž
My power is touching sky and the ground

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:46,000
My soul is spiralling in frozen fractals all around
Jau dvēsele gaisā virmo, Vējš tai augstu lidot ļauj
My soul dances in the air, Wind lets it fly high above

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,000
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
Tik doma viena sagriež sirdi vērpetē
Only one thought swirls my heart

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I'm never going back
Nav ceļa atpakaļ,
There is no way back

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,500
The past is in the past!
Viss paliek pagātnē!
Everything is left in the past!

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Let it go, let it go!
Lai nu snieg, Lai nu snieg!
Let it snow, Let it snow!

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Varu visam pāri celties
I can rise above all

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,000
Let it go, let it go!
Lai nu snieg, Lai nu snieg!
Let it snow, Let it snow!

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,500
That perfect girl is gone
Man nav kur atgriezties
I do not have a place to return

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,500
Here I stand in the light of day
Rīts ir klāt, Ledus elpot sāk
The morning is here, Ice starts breathing now

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,000
Let the storm rage on!
Sniega vētra nāk
Snow storm is coming

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,500
The cold never bothered me anyway.
Man sals ir paticis tik un tā.
I liked cold better.
