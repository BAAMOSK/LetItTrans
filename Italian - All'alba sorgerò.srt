the lyrics for the line "Let it go", in this translation.

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,
La neve che cade sopra di me
The snow is falling on me

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
not a footprint to be seen
copre tutto... col suo oblio
covering everything... with its oblivion

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,500
A kingdom of isolation,
In questo remoto regno
In this distant kingdom

00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
and it looks like I'm the queen
La regina... sono io
The queen... is me

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Ormai la tempesta nel mio cuore irrompe già
The storm is already breaking into my heart

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,000
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried
Non la fermerà la mia volontà
My will won't hold it

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Ho conservato ogni bugia
I kept every lie

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,500
Be the good girl you always had to be
Per il mondo la colpa è solo mia
To the world the fault is only mine

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Così non va, non sentirò
It can't go on like this, I'm not going to listen to

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, now they know!
... un altro "no"!
... another "no"!

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let it go, let it go!
D'ora in poi lascerò
From now on I'll let

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Can't hold it back any more!
che il cuore mi guidi un po'
my heart lead me a little

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Let it go, let it go!
Scorderò quel che so
I'll forget what I know

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,000
Turn away and slam the door!
E da oggi cambierò
And starting from today I'll change

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,500
I don't care what they're going to say
Resto qui, non andrò più via
I'm staying here, I will never leave

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,000
Let the storm rage on
Sono sola ormai
Now I'm alone

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The cold never bothered me anyway.
Da oggi il freddo è casa mia.
Starting from today the cold is my home.

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,500
It's funny how some distance
A volte è un bene
Sometimes it's good

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,000
Makes everything seem small
poter scappare un po'
to run away for a while

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,000
And the fears that once controlled me
Può sembrare un salto enorme
It may seem like a huge jump

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Can't get to me at all!
Ma io l'affronterò!
But I will face it!

00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,000
It's time to see what I can do
Non è un difetto, è una virtù
It isn't a fault, it's a virtue

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,500
To test the limits and break through
E non la fermerò mai più
And I won't hold it ever again

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,500
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
Nessun ostacolo per me
No obstacle for me

00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
I'm free!
Perché...
Because...

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,500
Let it go, let it go!
... d'ora in poi troverò
... from now on I'll find

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
I am one with the wind and sky
... la mia vera identità
... my true identity

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,000
Let it go, let it go!
E vivrò, sì vivrò
And I'll live, yes I'll live

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You'll never see me cry
per sempre in libertà!
forever free!

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,500
Here I stand, and here I'll stay,
Se è qui il posto mio
If my place is here

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,000
Let the storm rage on...
Io lo scoprirò.
I will find it out.

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,000
My power flurries through the air and to the ground
Il mio potere si diffonde intorno a me
My power is spreading around me

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:46,000
My soul is spiralling in frozen fractals all around
Il ghiaccio aumenta e copre ogni cosa accanto a sé
Ice is gathering and covering everything by

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,000
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
Un mio pensiero cristallizza la realtà
A thought from me crystallizes reality

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I'm never going back
Il resto è storia ormai
What's left is history by now

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,500
The past is in the past!
Che passa e se ne va!
Passing by and going away!

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Let it go, let it go!
Io lo so, sì, lo so
I know, yes, I know

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Come il sole tramonterà
I'll set like the sun

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,000
Let it go, let it go!
Perché poi, perché poi,
Because then, because then,

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,500
That perfect girl is gone
All'alba sorgerò
I'll rise at dawn

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,500
Here I stand in the light of day
Ecco qua la tempesta che
Here is the storm that

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,000
Let the storm rage on!
non si fermerà!
wont stop!

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,500
The cold never bothered me anyway.
Da oggi il destino appartiene a me.
Starting from today fate belongs to me.
