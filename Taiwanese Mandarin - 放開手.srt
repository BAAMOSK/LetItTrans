The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,

Bái xuě fēn fēi yī piàn yín sè shì jiè
A silvery-white world with the flurrying snow

放眼望去是沉寂
Fàng yǎn wàng qù shì chén jì
Greeted with solitary silence

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,500
A kingdom of isolation,

My thoughts are swirling like the raging waves in a storm

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,000
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried

Wú fǎ zài yā yì zuì hòu de rěn nài
Couldn't suppress it, end of my endurance.

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000

不要靠近不要相信
Bù yào kào jìn bù yào xiāng xìn
Do not get close and do not trust

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,500
Be the good girl you always had to be

不理会心中枷锁
Bù lǐ huì xīn zhōng jiā suǒ

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,500

It's funny how some distance
你我之间有距离
Nǐ wǒ zhī jiān yǒu jù lí

Makes everything seem small
一切变得渺小
yī qiè biàn dé miǎo xiǎo
Makes everything seem small

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,000
And the fears that once controlled me
那萦绕心头的恐惧
Nà yíng rào xīn tóu de kǒng jù
And the fear that once controlled me

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000

Lì liàng qiáng dà cóng dì dǐ zhí cuàn shàng yún xiāo
Great power soars through the clouds from the ground

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:46,000
My soul is spiralling in frozen fractals all around

Let it leave, let it leave!

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500

乌云后面就是曙光
Wū yún hòu miàn jiù shì shǔ guāng
Every cloud has a silver lining

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,000
Let it go, let it go!

Let it leave, let it leave!
