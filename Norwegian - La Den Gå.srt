The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,
Det glitrer hvitt over fjellet i natt,
It's gleaming white over the mountain tonight,

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
not a footprint to be seen
det er vakkert vintervær.
it's beautiful winter weather.

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,500
A kingdom of isolation,
I riket jeg bor alene,
In the realm I live alone,

00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
and it looks like I'm the queen
og som dronning står jeg her.
and as queen I'm standing here.

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Og vinden hyler lik som stormen i mitt bryst.
And the wind is howling like the storm that's in my chest.

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,000
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried
Holdt det ikke ut, himlen så min dyst.
Couldn't stand it, heaven saw my struggle.

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Slipp ingen inn, la ingen se,
Let no one in, let no one see,

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,500
Be the good girl you always had to be
slik er plikten, jeg er jo født til det.
Such is duty, I am born to that.

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Jeg dekket til. Det ingen så,
I covered up. What no one saw,

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, now they know!
det vet de nå!
they now know!

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let it go, let it go!
La den gå, la den gå!
Let it go, let it go!

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Can't hold it back any more!
Den kraften jeg skjulte før.
The power I hid before.

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Let it go, let it go!
La den gå, la den gå!
Let it go, let it go!

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,000
Turn away and slam the door!
Jeg har snudd og stengt en dør!
I have turned and closed a door!

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,500
I don't care what they're going to say
Jeg er lei, alt de tror de har sett.
I'm tired, of all they think they have seen.

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,000
Let the storm rage on
La det storme nå,
Let the storm rage on,

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The cold never bothered me anyway.
litt frost gjør meg ingenting uansett.
some frost doesn't bother me anyway.

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,500
It's funny how some distance
Litt avstand gjør det meste
Some distance makes everything

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,000
Makes everything seem small
så lite som det er.
seem as small as it is.

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,000
And the fears that once controlled me
Og den frykt som en gang holdt meg,
And the fear that once held me,

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Can't get to me at all!
kan ikke nå meg her!
cannot reach me here!

00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,000
It's time to see what I can do
Nå skal jeg se, hva jeg få til.
Now I will see, what I can do.

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,500
To test the limits and break through
Å teste grenser, når jeg vil.
To test the limits, when I want to.

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,500
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
For alle reglar er forbi.
For all the rules are in the past.

00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
I'm free!
Er fri!
Am free!

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,500
Let it go, let it go!
La den gå, la den gå!
Let it go, let it go!

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
I am one with the wind and sky
La min kraft fylle alt jeg ser.
Let my power fill all I see.

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,000
Let it go, let it go!
La den gå, la den gå!
Let it go, let it go!

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You'll never see me cry
Jeg gråter ikke mer.
I cry no more.

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,500
Here I stand, and here I'll stay,
Jeg blir her, der gleden er,
I stay here, where joy is,

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,000
Let the storm rage on...
La det storme nå...
Let the storm rage on...

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,000
My power flurries through the air and to the ground
Min kraft den jager gjennom luften ned mot jord.
My power chases through the air towards the ground.

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:46,000
My soul is spiralling in frozen fractals all around
Og sjelen er som frostne iskrystaller ifra nord
And the soul is like frozen ice crystals from the north

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,000
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
En tanke har tatt form som rim med nåler i
A thought has taken shape as rime with needles inside

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I'm never going back
Jeg vender aldri hjem,
I'll never turn back home,

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,500
The past is in the past!
all fortid er forbi!
the past is in the past!

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Let it go, let it go!
La den gå, la den gå!
Let it go, let it go!

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Jeg skal stige lik solen nå.
I will now rise like the sun.

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,000
Let it go, let it go!
La den gå, la den gå!
Let it go, let it go!

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,500
That perfect girl is gone
Perfekt er fortid så
The past is perfect like that

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,500
Here I stand in the light of day
Jeg er klar, og jeg smiler bredt
I'm ready, and I'm smiling broadly

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,000
Let the storm rage on!
La det storme her!
Let the storm rage here!

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,500
The cold never bothered me anyway.
Litt frost gjør meg ingenting uansett.
Some frost doesn't bother me anyway.
