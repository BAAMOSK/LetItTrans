The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,
La neu de nit té un to més bonic
The snow at night has more beautiful tone

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
not a footprint to be seen
no hi ha traces, tot és blanc
there are no traces, all is white

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,500
A kingdom of isolation,
d'un regne aïllat del món

00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
and it looks like I'm the queen
en sóc reina en aquest instant

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
El vent fereix la nit per dins la tempestat

He acabat fugint tot i que he lluitat.
I ended up running away, although I have fought.

Don't let them in, don't let them see
No els vulla dins, no els vull aquí
I don't want them inside, I don't want them here

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,500
Be the good girl you always had to be
"Porta't molt bé" sempre em deia a mi
"Behave very well" he always said to me

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Desat no ho pot saber ningú
Hidden, no one can know

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, now they know!
Ja ho sap algú!
Now someone knows!

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let it go, let it go!
Vol volar, el deixo anar!
It wants to fly, I let it go!

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Can't hold it back any more!
Ni puc ni el vull amagar
Neither can I, nor do I, want to hide it

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Let it go, let it go!
Vol volar, el deixo anar!
It wants to fly, I let it go!

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,000
Turn away and slam the door!
Ja tant és, ja tant me fa!
Now it doesn't matter, now I don't care!

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,500
I don't care what they're going to say
És igual el que puguin dir
It doesn't matter what they could say

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,000
Let the storm rage on
Deixa el vent cridar
Let the wind cry

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The cold never bothered me anyway.
El fred no m'ha fet mai cap mal a mi.
The cold has never hurt me.

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,500
It's funny how some distance
És curiós com la distància
It's curious how the distance

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,000
Makes everything seem small
ho fa tot molt petit
makes everything very small

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,000
And the fears that once controlled me
i les pors que em dominaven
and the fears that dominated me

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Can't get to me at all!
per sempre han fugit!

It's time to see what I can do
Ara veuré el que puc fer

To test the limits and break through
Quins límits jo superaré

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,500
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
Ni el bé ni el mal no són per mi
Neither good nor bad, they're not for me

00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
I'm free!
Per fi!
At last!

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,500
Let it go, let it go!
Vol volar, el deixo anar!

I am one with the wind and sky
Sóc part de la neu i el vent

Sóc aquí, i no em mouran

Let the storm rage on...
Deixa el vent cridar...

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,000
My power flurries through the air and to the ground
Tinc un poder que va dels cims fins els averns
I have a power which goes from the summits to the underworld

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:46,000
My soul is spiralling in frozen fractals all around
De la meva ànima en surten gels que ni en comprenc
Ice leaves my soul, that I don't even understand

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,000
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I un pensament sorgeix com un gran dard gelat
And a thought emerges like a great ice dart

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I'm never going back
No penso tornar mai

Vol volar, el deixo anar!

And I'll rise like the break of dawn
I com l'alba jo creixeré
And I'll rise up like the break of dawn

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,000
Let it go, let it go!
Vol volar, el deixo anar!
It wants to fly, I let it go!

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,500
That perfect girl is gone
Ja no em portaré bé
I won't behave well any more

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,500
Here I stand in the light of day
Sóc aquí, s'alça un nou matí
Here I am, a new morning is rising up

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,000
