(Note that the language name should probably be "Slovak"
rather than "Slovakian". I've followed the Disney-published
track titles, but if anyone is offended by my misnaming of
the language, I'll change it to Slovak.)

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,
Sneh na horách v noci biely až starch
The snwo on the mountains tonight is white and frightening

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
not a footprint to be seen
život skryl tvár predo mnou
Life has hidden its face from me

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,500
A kingdom of isolation,
V tom král'ovstve bielych tieňov
In this kingdom of white shadows,

00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
and it looks like I'm the queen
asi budem král'ovnou
I will probably be queen

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
No vo mne vnútri búrka zúri a ja viem
But a storm rages inside of me and I know

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,000
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried
V sebe to skrývat' viac nedokážem
I can't hide it in me any more

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Nechaj to tak čo v tebe vrie
Leave alone what boils in you

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,500
Be the good girl you always had to be
A bud' len tou čo sa vždy správat' vie
And just be the one who knows how to behave

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Skry každý cit l'ud'om sa vzdial'
Hide every emotion, stay far away from people

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, now they know!
A lumlám sa vzdaj!
And give in to the mists!

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let it go, let it go!
Von to dám, zvnútra dám!
I'll release it, release what's inside!

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Can't hold it back any more!
Viac to v sebe neskrývam
I'm not going to hide in me any more

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Let it go, let it go!
Von to dám, zvnútra dám!
I'll release it, release what's inside!

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,000
Turn away and slam the door!
A už pokoj v sebe mám
And now, I feel peace inside of me

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,500
I don't care what they're going to say
Tu stojím na všetko mám dost' stil
Standing here, I have enough strength to do anything

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,000
Let the storm rage on
Nech si zúri mráz
Let the frost come

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The cold never bothered me anyway.
Ved' chlad mi aj tak nikdy nevadil.
Because the cold never bothered me anyway.

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,500
It's funny how some distance
Je zvláštne ako dial'ka
It's strange how distance

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,000
Makes everything seem small
Dokáže zmenšit' svet
Can make the world small

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,000
And the fears that once controlled me
Vo mne niečo krásne klíči
When something beautiful is born

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Can't get to me at all!
Ked' strachu viac už niet!
When there's no more fear!

00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,000
It's time to see what I can do
Nech všetci vedia vôkol že
Let everyone around know that

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,500
To test the limits and break through
čo budem chciet' to dokážem
Whatever I want, I can achieve

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,500
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
Pravidlá žiadne som mnou
There are no rules for me

00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
I'm free!
Vol'ná!
Free!

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,500
Let it go, let it go!
Von to dám, zvnútra dám!
I'll release it, release what's inside!

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
I am one with the wind and sky
Budem vetrom i oblohou
I'll be the wind and sky

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,000
Let it go, let it go!
Von to dám, zvnútra dám!
I'll release it, release what's inside!

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You'll never see me cry
A slzy sú za mnou
And the tears are left behind me

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,500
Here I stand, and here I'll stay,
Tu stojím a chcem tu stát'
Standing here, and I want to stand here,

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,000
Let the storm rage on...
Nech si zúri mráz...
Let the frost come...

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,000
My power flurries through the air and to the ground
Na zem sa vzduchom valí sila ktorú mám
My power rolls onto the ground by the air

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:46,000
My soul is spiralling in frozen fractals all around
A duša sa chce vyhnút' zamrznutým náladám
And my soul wants to avoid the frozen moods

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,000
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
Len jedna myšlienka sa vznáša nad hlavou
Only one thought floats over my head

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I'm never going back
Všetko mám pred sebou
I have everything before me

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,500
The past is in the past!
čo bolo je za mnou!
What was, I leave behind!

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Let it go, let it go!
Von to dám, zvnútra dám!
I'll release it, release what's inside!

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Budem úsvitom nových rán
I'll be the dawn of new mornings

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,000
Let it go, let it go!
Von to dám, zvnútra dám!
I'll release it, release what's inside!

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,500
That perfect girl is gone
Ja skvelý pocit mám
I am feeling great

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,500
Here I stand in the light of day
Tu stojím v svetle krásnych dni
Standing here, in the light of beautiful days

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,000
Let the storm rage on!
Nech si zúri mráz!
Let the frost come!

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,500
The cold never bothered me anyway.
Ved' chlad mi aj tak nikdy nevadil.
Because the cold never bothered me anyway.
