00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,
Salju putih menutupi malam
The white snow covers through the night

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
not a footprint to be seen
Tiada jejak terlihat
No more footsteps to be seen

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,500
A kingdom of isolation,
Kerajaan yang terasing
An isolated kingdom

00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
and it looks like I'm the queen
Dan akulah ratunya
And I am the queen

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Hembusan bayu bak gelora jiwaku
The blowing breeze reflects the turbulence of my soul

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,000
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried
Puas ku cuba untuk memendamnya
I'm tired of trying to hide it away

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Jangan sampai mereka tahu
Don't let everybody know

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,500
Be the good girl you always had to be
Harus jadi yang diharapkan
Have to be what they expect of me

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Lindungilah yang sebenar
Shelter the truth

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, now they know!
Kini aku
So now I will!

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let it go, let it go!
Bebaskan, bebaskan
Let it go, let it go

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Can't hold it back any more!
Tak mampu bertahan lagi
Can't hold it in any more

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Let it go, let it go!
Bebaskan, bebaskan
Let it go, let it go

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,000
Turn away and slam the door!
Ku cuba sedayaku
I am trying with all I can

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,500
I don't care what they're going to say
Peduli apa yang dikata
Just ignore whatever they would say

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,000
Let the storm rage on
Jiwa ku beku
My soul is ice cold

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The cold never bothered me anyway.
Kedinginan tak pernah menggangguku
The cold never bothered me anyway.

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,500
It's funny how some distance
Kini dapat ku lihat
Now I can see

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,000
Makes everything seem small
Jelas dari kejauhan
clearly from across the distance

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,000
And the fears that once controlled me
Ketakutan terpendam
The fear I once kept inside me

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Can't get to me at all!
Telah dapat ku lepaskan
I was able to set it free

00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,000
It's time to see what I can do
Sedayanya aku cuba
With all my might I will try

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,500
To test the limits and break through
Mengguna segala kuasa
To convey my whole power

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,500
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
Bebas mengecap nikmatnya
Free to grasp its joyous splendor

00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
I'm free!
Ku bebas
I'm free!

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,500
Let it go, let it go!
Bebaskan, bebaskan
Let it go, let it go

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
I am one with the wind and sky
Terbanglah susuri awan
Fly and trace along the clouds

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,000
Let it go, let it go!
Bebaskan, bebaskan
Let it go, let it go

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You'll never see me cry
Takkan aku berduka
I will no longer live sadness

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,500
Here I stand, and here I'll stay,
Disini berdiri megah
Here I stand with pride

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,000
Let the storm rage on...
Mula yang baru
Time to start anew

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,000
My power flurries through the air and to the ground
Kuasaku buat hidup bercelaru
My powers have made my life so mystified

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:46,000
My soul is spiralling in frozen fractals all around
Jiwaku bak salju yang sejuk juga membeku
My soul is like the cold and freezing icy snow

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,000
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
Membentuk permata menjadi mahkota
Shaping crystals into tiaras

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I'm never going back
Sejarahku kekal
My history remains

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,500
The past is in the past!
Menjadi sejarah
as history!

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Let it go, let it go!
Bebaskan, bebaskan
Let it go, let it go

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Ku bangkit di dunia baru
I will rise in a brand new world

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,000
Let it go, let it go!
Bebaskan, bebaskan
Let it go, let it go

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,500
That perfect girl is gone
Tidak seperti dulu
Never like before

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,500
Here I stand in the light of day
Disini berdiri megah
Here I stand with pride

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,000
Let the storm rage on!
Mula yang baru
Time to start anew

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,500
The cold never bothered me anyway.
Kedinginan tak pernah meggangguku.
The cold never bothered me anyway.
