00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,879
I didn't know they did that any more
Credevo che non accadesse più!
I thought it wouldn't happen again!

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,130
Who knew we owned 8,000 salad plates?
Non ho mai visto tanti piatti, qua!
I've never seen so many dishes, here!

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,962
For years I've roamed these empty halls
Ormai, da tempo immemore
It's been time immemorial

00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,562
Why have a ballroom with no balls?
Qui non si vede un ospite!

But wow! Am I so ready for this change!
Mi sento emozionata più che mai!

'Cause for the first time in forever
Questa è la vita che volevo
This is the life I wanted

00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,359
There'll be music, there'll be light
Niente mura da guardare.
No walls to stare at.

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,802
For the first time in forever
Avrò quello che sognavo
I'm going to have what I dreamed

00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,848
I'll be dancing through the night
Oggi io potrò ballare.
Today I will dance.

00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,999
Don't know if I'm elated or gassy
Non posso sopportare l’attesa
I can't stand to wait

00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,965
But I'm somewhere in that zone
Penso che forse impazzirò
I think I might go crazy

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,002
'Cause for the first time in forever
Però stasera, di sicuro,
But tonight, for sure,

00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,799
I won't be alone

E se incontrassi... Quello Giusto?
What if I met... The One?

00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,319
Tonight, imagine me gown and all
Avrò uno splendido abito
I'll be wearing a beautiful dress

00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,639
Fetchingly draped against the wall
Semplice ma bellissimo,
Simple, but wonderful,

00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,164
The picture of sophisticated grace
Ammireranno tutti quanti me!
Everybody will admire me!

00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,639
I suddenly see him standing there
E poi, d'improvviso, lui è lì
Then suddenly there he is

00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,959
A beautiful stranger, tall and fair
Nessuno è più bello di così
Nobody is more handsome than him

00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,639
I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face!
Ed è meglio se mi butto sul buffet
Better if I plunge into the buffet

00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,359
But then we laugh and talk all evening
Staremo insieme fino all'alba,
We'll stay together until dawn,

00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,639
Which is totally bizarre
Lui si innamorerà
He will fall in love

00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,845
Nothing like the life I've led so far
Solo che ancora non lo sa!
Only he doesn't know it yet!

00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,205
For the first time in forever
Oggi, per la prima volta,
Today, for the first time,

00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,883
There'll be magic, there'll be fun
Proprio come per magia,
Just as by magic,

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,364
For the first time in forever
Ho La vita che sognavo,
I have the life I dreamed of

00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:23,083
I could be noticed by someone
Per una notte, in mano mia.
In my hands for one night

00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,767
And I know it is totally crazy
È un'idea del tutto pazzesca,
It's an absolutely crazy idea

00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,401
To dream I'd find romance
E sembra folle, ma...
And it sounds insane, but...

00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,409
But for the first time in forever
Credo di avere per davvero
I think I really have...

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,487
At least I've got a chance!
Un'opportunità.
... a chance.

Till now I've been alone, but...

<i>Conceal</i>
<i>Celare</i>

<i>Dovrai soffrire, ancora un po'.</i>
<i>You'll have to suffer a little</i>

00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,959
I know it all ends tomorrow
È un giorno da ricordare,
It's a day to be remembered,

00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,970
So it has to be today!
Sono certa che lo sia!
I'm pretty sure it is!

00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,968
'Cause for the first time in forever
E so che per la prima volta
And I know that for the first time

It's warmer than I thought.
È più caldo di quanto pensassi.
[It's hotter than I thought.]

00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,679
What is that amazing smell?
Cos'è questo profumo delizioso?
[What is this delicious smell?]

00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,726
Chocolate.
Cioccolato!
[Chocolate!]

00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,920
Your Majesty.
Vostra Maestà.
[Your Majesty.]

00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,045
The Duke of Weaseltown.
Il duca di Wafertown.
[The Duke of Wafertown.]

00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,044
"Weselton"! Duke of Weselton, Your Majesty.
"Weselton"! Il duca di Weselton, Vostra Maestà!
["Weselton"! The Duke of Weselton, Your Majesty!]

00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,679
As your closest partner in trade it seems only fitting
Come vostro major alleato commerciale...
[As your major ally commercial...]

00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,650
that I offer you your first dance as queen.
è doveroso invitarvi al primo ballo da regina.
[it is right to invite you to the first dance queen.]

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,365
One-two, and jump.
Uno, due, saltello.
[One, two, hop.]

00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,881
Uh...

00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,919
Thank you. Only, I don't dance.
Grazie, più troppo non ballo.
[Thank you, most do not dance too.]

00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,199
Oh...

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,239
But my sister does.
Ma mia sorella sì!
[But my sister, yes!]

00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,599
What? - Oh! Lucky you.
Allora? - Che fortunata!
[So what? - How lucky!]

00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,719
Oh, I don't think...
Non credo...
[I do not believe...]

00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,127
If you swoon, let me know. I'll catch you.
Se svenire, ditelo. Vi prenderò.
[If you pass out, say so. I will take you.]

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:34,839
Sorry.
Scusa.
[Sorry.]

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,719
Like an agile peacock.
Come un agile pavone.
[As a nimble peacock.]

00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,639
Ow! Ow.

00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,719
Speaking of, so great to have the gates open.
A proposito... È splendido che abbia aperto le porte.
[By the way... It's wonderful to have opened the doors.]

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,922
Why did they shut them in the first place?
Perché sono state tanto chiuse?
[Why he was so closed?]

00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,719
Do you know the reason? Hmm?
Ne conoscete la ragione?
[Do you know the reason?]

00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,559
No.

00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,091
All right. Hang on!
D'accordo. Tenetevi.
[All right. Stay.]

00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,919
They don't call me the "Little Dipper" for nothing!
Non per niente mi chiamano Il Re del Caschè!
[No wonder they call me King of Caschè!]

00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,079
Oh-ho!

00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,727
Like a chicken with the face of a monkey, I fly.
Come un pollo dalla faccia da scimmia, volo!
[Like a chicken-faced monkey, fly!]

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,719
Let me know when you're ready
Ditemi quando siete pronta
[Tell me when you're ready]

00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,919
for another round, Milady.
per un altro giro, Milady.
[for another round, Milady.]

00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,851
Well, he was sprightly.
Beh, molto agile.
[Well, very agile.]

00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,079
Especially for a man in heels.
Specie per un uomo con i tacchi alti.
[Especially for a man with high heels.]

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,850
Are you okay?

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,649
I've never been better. This is so nice.
Mai stata meglio. È così bello.
[Never better. It's so beautiful.]

00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,122
I wish it could be like this all the time.
Mi piacerebbe che fosse così sempre.
[I wish it were always so.]

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,960
Me, too.
Anch'io.
[Me too.]

00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,679
But it can't.
Ma non si può.
[But you can not.]

00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,882
Why not? - It just can't.
Perché no? - Non si può.
[Why not? - You can not.]

00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,770
Excuse me for a minute.
Scusa ???.
[Excuse me ???.]

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,249
I'd be honored.

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,881
Glad I caught you.
Ti ho presa, grazie cielo.
[I've got you, thank heaven.]

00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,326
Hans.

00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,679
I often had a whole parlor to myself to slide!
Una volta avevo un salone per scivolare!
[Once I had a room to slip!]

00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,719
Oops!

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,119
Sorry.

00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,519
Your physique helps, I'm sure, too.
Il tuo fisico aiuta, credo.
[Your physical help, I think.]

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,006
Ah.

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,479
What's this?
Che cos'è?
[What is it?]

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,959
Uh, I was born with it.
Ci sono nata.
[I was born there.]

00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,367
Although, I dreamed I was kissed by a troll.
Ma in sogno mi ha baciata un troll.
[But in the dream he kissed a troll.]

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,799
I like it.
Mi piace.
[I like it.]

00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,479
Yeah, the whole thing.
Si, in un sol boccone.
[Yes, in one gulp.]

00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,761
You got it.
Ce l'hai fatta.
[You did.]

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,766
Okay, wait, wait. So, you have how many brothers?
Bravo, scusa ???. E quanti sono fratelli?
[Bravo, excuse me ???. And how many brothers?]

00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,889
Twelve older brothers.
Dodici grandi di me
[Twelve older than me]

00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:26,519
Three of them pretended I was invisible, literally, for two years.
Tre di loro hanno finto che io fossi invisibile, letteralmente, per due anni.
[Three of them pretended I was invisible, literally, for two years.]

00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,846
That's horrible.
È orribile.
[It's horrible.]

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,486
It's what brothers do.
Il fratelli lo fanno così.
[The brothers do so.]

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,211
And sisters.
Anche le sorelle.
[Even the sisters.]

00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,719
Elsa and I were really close when we were little.
Elsa e io eravamo unite da piccole.
[Elsa and I were joined when we were small.]

00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,199
But then, one day, she just shut me out,
Un giorno, mi ha esclusa dalla sua vita...
[One day, I was excluded from her life...]

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,721
and I never knew why.
e ancora non so il perché.
[and still I do not know why.]

00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,199
I would never shut you out.
Io non ti escluderei mai.
[I do not exclude you ever.]

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,161
Okay, can I just say something crazy?
Ecco, vorrei... Posso dire una follia?
Well, I'd wish... Can I say a crazy thing?

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,766
<i>I love crazy.</i>
<i>Amo le follie.</i>
<i>I love crazy things.</i>

00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,649
All my life has been a series of doors in my face
Ho sperato molte volte in qualcosa per me
So many times did I hope in something for me

00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,599
And then suddenly I bump into you
Come un fulmine sei comparso tu.
Then you appeared like lightning.

00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,959
<i>I was thinking the same thing, because, like...</i>
<i>È la stessa cosa che penso io, perché...</i>
<i>I think the same, because...</i>

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,209
<i>I've been searching my whole life to find my own place</i>
<i>Non avevo mai trovato un posto, finché,</i>
<i>I had never found a place, until,</i>

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,959
<i>And maybe it's the party talking, or the chocolate fondue</i>
<i>All’improvviso una speranza o qualcosa di più.</i>
<i>Suddenly a hope, or something more.</i>

00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,079
But with you
Ma se noi...
But if we...

00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,719
<i>But with you I found my place</i>
<i>Ma se noi stiamo insieme</i>
<i>But if we are together</i>

00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,039
I see your face
Mi sento bene.
I feel good.

00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:17,039
And it's nothing like I've ever known before
Ed è facile, adesso che io so
And it's easy, now that I'm aware...

00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,409
Love is an open door!
Che occasione ho!
of the chance I've got!

00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,039
Love is an open door!
Che occasione ho!
of the chance I've got!

00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,719
Love is an open door
Che occasione ho
of the chance I've got!

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,479
With you
Con te
with you

00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,445
Love is an open door
Che occasione ho
of the chance I've got!

00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,159
<i>I mean, it's crazy</i>
<i>Non trovi strano...</i>
<i>Don't you think it's odd...</i>

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,459
What?
Cosa?
What?

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,522
<i>We finish each other's</i>
<i>Sentirsi davvero...</i>
<i>Feeling so...</i>

00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,022
Sandwiches
Simili!
alike!

00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,759
<i>That's what I was gonna say!</i>
<i>Stavo per dirlo io!</i>
<i>I was going to say that!</i>

00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,959
I've never met someone
È bello accorgersi
It's wonderful to realize

00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,079
Who thinks so much like me
Che sono uguale a te.
That I'm just like you.

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,559
Jinx! Jinx again!
Flic! Flic di nuovo!
Flic! Flic again!

00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,259
Our mental synchronization
Abbiamo fatto un duetto
We're a duet

00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,209
Can have but one explanation
che sembra proprio perfetto.
that seems just perfect.

00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,450
You and I were just meant to be
Tu ormai lo sai più di me
And you know it better than me

00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,959
Say goodbye
Dì addio
say goodbye

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,004
To the pain of the past
Alla malinconia.
To sadness

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,649
We don't have to feel it anymore
Tutto cambia, ora che io so
Everything is different now that I'm aware...

00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,846
Love is an open door
Che occasione ho
of the chance I've got!

00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:19,199
Love is an open door!
Che occasione ho
of the chance I've got!

00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,319
Life can be so much more
E non ti lascerò
And I won't leave you

00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,319
With you
Mai più - Perché - Lo so - Che tu
Forever - Because - I know - That you

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,679
Love is an open
Sei tutto ciò che
Are everything

00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,362
Door
Ho.
I've got. 

00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,649
<i>Can I say something crazy?</i>
<i>Posso dire una follia?</i>
<i>Can I say a crazy thing?</i>

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,644
<i>Will you marry me?</i>
<i>Vuoi sposarmi?</i>
<i>Will you marry me?</i>

00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,844
Can I say something even crazier?
Posso dire una follia ancora più folle?
Can I say an even crazier crazy thing?

00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,401
Yes!
Sì!
Yes!

00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,769
Coming through. Excuse me. Oh...

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,559
Pardon. Sorry. Oh!
Scusate, permesso.
[Sorry, permission.]

00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,285
Can we just get around you there?
Possiamo girarvi intorno?
[We can turn away around?]

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,444
Thank you. Oh! There she is.
Grazie. Eccola lì.
[Thank you. There it is.]

00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,639
Elsa!

00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,479
I mean, Queen. Me again. Um...
Voglio dire, Regina. Sono sempre io.
[I mean, Regina. It's always me.]

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,287
May I present Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.
Vi presento il principe Hans delle Isole del Sud.
[Meet Prince Hans Island South.]

00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,170
Your Majesty.
Maestà.
[Majesty.]

00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,759
We would like...
Vorremmo...
[We would like...]

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,879
Uh, your blessing...
La vostra benedizione...
[Your blessing...]

00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,004
Of our marriage.
Al nostro matrimonio!
[At our wedding!]

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,284
Marriage? - Yes!
Che? Matrimonio? - Sì!
[What? Marriage? - Yes!]

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,839
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
Perdona, sono confusa.
[Forgive, I'm confused.]

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,159
Well, we haven't worked out all the details ourselves.
Dobbiamo ancora decidere i dettagli.
[We still have to decide the details.]

00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,079
We'll need a few days to plan the ceremony.
Ma pianificheremo tutto.
[But we will plan everything.]

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,399
Of course, we'll have soup, roast, and ice cream. And then...
Ci saranno zuppa, arrosto, e gelato.
[There will be soup, roast, and ice cream.]

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,761
Wait. Would we live here?
Aspetta. Vivremo qui?
[Wait. We will live here?]

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,999
Here? - Absolutely!
Qui? Assolutamente sì!
[Here? Yes absolutely!]

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,079
Anna!

00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,679
Oh! We can invite all twelve of your brothers to stay with us.
Invitiamo i tuoi dodici fratelli a stare qui.
[We invite your twelve brothers stay here.]

00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,959
What? No, no, no.

00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,288
Of course we have the room......
ll posto c'è!
[The place is!]

00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,319
Wait, slow down. No one's brothers are staying here.
Calma. Una momento. Nessun fratello starà qui.
[Calm. A moment. No brother will stay here.]

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,885
No one is getting married.
Nessuno matrimonio.
[No marriage.]

00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,519
Wait, what?
Aspetta, che?
[Wait, what?]

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,564
May I talk to you, please? Alone.
Posso parlarti, per favore? In privato.
[Can I talk to you, please? In private.]

00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,801
No. Whatever you have to say, you can say to both of us.
No. Puoi parlare a tutti e due.
[No. You can talk to both.]

00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,206
Fine. You can't marry a man you just met.
Bene. Non sposi un uomo che conosci appena.
[All right. Do not marry a man you barely know.]

00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,239
You can if it's true love.
Sì, se è vero amore.
[Yes, it is true love.]

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,239
Anna, what do you know about true love?
Anna, cosa sai del vero amore?
[Anna, what do you know about true love?]

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,359
More than you.
Molto più di te.
[Much more than you.]

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,199
All you know is how to shut people out.
Tu escludi solo la gente dalla tua vita.
[You may only exclude people from your life.]

00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,171
You asked for my blessing, but my answer is no.
Chiedete la mia benedizione. La mia risposta è no.
[Ask my blessing. My answer is no.]

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,799
Now, excuse me.
Con permesso.
[With permission.]

00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,439
Your Majesty, if I may ease your...
Maestà, se permettete.
[Majesty, if you will.]

00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,722
No, you may not. And I think you should go.
No, e penso che tu debba andare.
[No, and I think you should go.]

00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,839
The party is over. Close the gates.
La festa è finita. Chiudete le porte.
[The party is over. Close the doors.]

00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,919
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,599
Elsa, no, no! Wait.
Elsa, no, no! Aspetta.
[Elsa, no, no! Wait.]

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,801
Give me my glove!

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,719
Elsa, please, please.
Ridammi il guanto!
[Give me the glove!]

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,604
I can't live like this anymore!
Elsa, ti prego. Ti prego non posso più vivere così io!
[Elsa, please. I pray I can live like me!]

00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,527
Then leave.
Allora vattene.
[Then go.]

00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,719
What did I ever do to you?
Che cosa ti ho fatto?
[What have I done?]

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,919
Enough, Anna.
Basta, Anna.
[Just, Anna.]

00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,168
No, why? Why do you shut me out?
No perché? Perché mi escludi?
[No, why? Why do you exclude?]

Sung by Serena Autieri

00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,980
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,
La neve che cade sopra di me
The snow is falling on me

00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,980
not a footprint to be seen
copre tutto... col suo oblio
covering everything... with its oblivion

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,480
A kingdom of isolation,
In questo remoto regno
In this distant kingdom

00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,980
and it looks like I'm the queen
La regina... sono io
The queen... is me

00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:43,980
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Ormai la tempesta nel mio cuore irrompe già
The storm is already breaking into my heart

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:50,980
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried
Non la fermerà la mia volontà
My will won't hold it

00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,980
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Ho conservato ogni bugia
I kept every lie

00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:59,480
Be the good girl you always had to be
Per il mondo la colpa è solo mia
To the world the fault is only mine

00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,980
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Così non va, non sentirò
It can't go on like this, I'm not going to listen to

00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,980
Well, now they know!
... un altro "no"!
... another "no"!

00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,980
Let it go, let it go!
D'ora in poi lascerò
From now on I'll let

00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:15,980
Can't hold it back any more!
che il cuore mi guidi un po'
my heart lead me a little

00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,480
Let it go, let it go!
Scorderò quel che so
I'll forget what I know

00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,980
Turn away and slam the door!
E da oggi cambierò
And starting from today I'll change

00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:29,480
I don't care what they're going to say
Resto qui, non andrò più via
I'm staying here, I won't go away ever again

00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:33,980
Let the storm rage on
Sono sola ormai
Now I'm alone

00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,980
The cold never bothered me anyway.
Da oggi il freddo è casa mia.
Starting from today the cold is my home.

00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,480
It's funny how some distance
A volte è un bene
Sometimes it's good

00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,980
Makes everything seem small
poter scappare un po'
to run away for a while

00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,980
And the fears that once controlled me
Può sembrare un salto enorme
It may seem like a huge jump

00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:54,980
Can't get to me at all!
Ma io l'affronterò!
But I will face it!

00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,980
It's time to see what I can do
Non è un difetto, è una virtù
It isn't a fault, it's a virtue

00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,480
To test the limits and break through
E non la fermerò mai più
And I won't hold it ever again

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,480
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
Nessun ostacolo per me
No obstacle for me

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,480
I'm free!
Perché...
Because...

00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:13,480
Let it go, let it go!
... d'ora in poi troverò
... from now on I'll find

00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,480
I am one with the wind and sky
... la mia vera identità
... my true identity

00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,980
Let it go, let it go!
E vivrò, sì vivrò
And I'll live, yes I'll live

00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:24,980
You'll never see me cry
per sempre in libertà!
forever free!

00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:31,480
Here I stand, and here I'll stay,
Se è qui il posto mio
If my place is here

00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,980
Let the storm rage on...
Io lo scoprirò.
I will find it out.

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:48,980
My power flurries through the air and to the ground
Il mio potere si diffonde intorno a me
My power is spreading around me

00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:55,980
My soul is spiralling in frozen fractals all around
Il ghiaccio aumenta e copre ogni cosa accanto a sé
Ice is gathering and covering everything by

00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,980
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
Un mio pensiero cristallizza la realtà
A thought from me crystallizes reality

00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,480
I'm never going back
Il resto è storia ormai
What's left is history by now

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,480
The past is in the past!
Che passa e se ne va!
Passing by and going away!

00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,480
Let it go, let it go!
Io lo so, sì, lo so
I know, yes, I know

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,480
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Come il sole tramonterà
I'll set like the sun

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,980
Let it go, let it go!
Perché poi, perché poi,
Because then, because then,

00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:25,480
That perfect girl is gone
All'alba sorgerò
I'll rise at dawn

00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:34,480
Here I stand in the light of day
Ecco qua la tempesta che
Here is the storm that

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,980
Let the storm rage on!
non si fermerà!
wont stop!

[Of course I do not help the most.]

"Ma non avrai la slitta nuova se morirà."
["But you will not die if the new sled."]

00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,931
I think, actually, it's up.
Credo che sia lassù.
[I think it's up there.]

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,399
Sometimes, I really don't like you.
Certe volte non ti sopporto.

Hold up! We're coming.
Aspetta. Arriviamo!

It's completely frozen.
È completamente ghiacciata.

00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,439
Will she?

00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,119
Yeah. Now, come on.
Sì, andiamo.
[Yes, let's go.]

00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,959
This way to the North Mountain?
È laggiù la Montagna del Nord?
[Is there the Mountain North?]

00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,599
More like this way.
Più lassù.
[More up there.]

00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,162
I never knew winter could be so beautiful.
Non credevo che l'inverno fosse così bello.
[I did not think that the winter was so beautiful.]

00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,559
Yeah.
Sì.
[Yes.]

00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,683
It really is beautiful, isn't it?
È bello vero, no?
[It's real nice, no?]

00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,361
But it's so white.
Ma è tutto così bianco.
[But everything is so white.]

00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,610
You know, how about a little color?
Che ne dite di un po' di colore?
[How about a bit' of color?]

00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,999
I'm thinking maybe some crimson, chartreuse.
Pensavo al rosso cremisi, al verde Caraibi.
[I thought to crimson red, green Caribbean.]

00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,645
How about yellow?
E il giallo?
[And the yellow?]

00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,963
No, not yellow. Yellow and snow?
No, giallo no. Giallo sulla neve?
[No, no yellow. Yellow snow?]

00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,479
No go.
Non va.
[It does not work.]

00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,930
Am I right?
Dico bene?
[Am I right?]

00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,239
You're creepy.
Fai spavento!
[Make fright!]

00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,639
I don't want it.
Non lo voglio.
[I do not want it.]

00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,079
Back at you. - Please don't drop me.
Riprendilo. - Cado.
[Take it back. - Cado.]

00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,359
Come on, it's just a head.
Orsù, è solo una testa.
[Come on, it's just a head.]

00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,679
All right. We got off to a bad start.
Cominciamo male.
[Let's start badly.]

00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,086
Ew, ew, ew, the body!
Ah! il corpo.
[Ah! the body.]

00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,799
Wait, what am I looking at right now?
Ehi, che cosa vedo?
[Hey, what do I see?]

00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,519
Why are you hanging off the earth like a bat?
State a testa in giù come pipistrelli?
[State upside down like bats?]

00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,999
All right, wait one second.
Aspetta.
[Wait.]

00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,531
Oh. Uh...

00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,759
Oh!

00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,325
Thank you. - You're welcome.
Grazie. - Figurati.
[Thank you. - Imagine.]

00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,399
Now, I'm perfect.
Ora sono perfetto.
[Now I am perfect.]

00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,086
Well, almost.
Quasi perfetto!
[Almost perfect!]

00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,159
It was like my whole life got turned upside down.
Era come se tutta la mia vita fosse sottosopra.
[It was as if my whole life was upside down.]

00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,441
Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry!
Troppo forte. Scusa!
[Too strong. Sorry!]

00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,359
Head rush! - I was just... Are you okay?
Che vertigini! - Stai bene?
[What vertigo! - Are you OK?]

00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,879
Are you kidding me? I am wonderful!
Scherzi? Una meraviglia!
[Seriously? A marvel!]

00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,730
I've always wanted a nose.
Lo volevo da sempre un nasino.
[I always wanted a little nose.]

00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,119
So cute.
Che carino.
[So cute.]

00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,879
It's like a little baby unicorn.
È come un piccolo unicorno.
[It's like a little unicorn.]

00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,999
But... Hey! Whoa!

00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,039
Oh.

00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,049
I love it even more.
Lo amo ancora di più.
[I love him even more.]

00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,085
All right, let's start this thing over.
Va bene, ricominciamo da capo.
[Okay, we start over.]

00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,239
Hi, everyone.
Ciao a tutti.
[Hello everyone.]

00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,319
I'm Olaf.
Io sono Olaf.
[I'm Olaf.]

00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,726
And I like warm hugs.
E amo i caldi abbracci.
[And I love the warm hugs.]

00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,281
Olaf?

00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,409
That's right. Olaf.
È vero, Olaf!
[True, Olaf!]

00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,608
And you are?
E tu sei?
[And you are?]

00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,081
Oh. Um...

00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,239
I'm Anna.
Io sono Anna.
[I am Anna.]

00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,679
And who's the funky-looking donkey over there?
E chi è quel somarello lì?
[And who is the donkey there?]

00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,239
That's Sven.
Quello è Sven.
[What is Sven.]

00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,199
And who's the reindeer?
E la renna chi è?
[And the reindeer who is?]

00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,239
Sven.

00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,079
Oh, they're... Oh. Okay. That makes things easier for me.
Okay. È più facile ???.
[Okay. It's easier???.]

00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,760
Aw, look at him trying to kiss my nose.
???, vuole baciarmi il naso.
[???, He wants to kiss my nose.]

00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,883
I like you, too.
Mi piaci anche tu.
[I like you too.]

00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,522
Olaf. Did Elsa build you? - Yeah. Why?
Olaf. Ti ha fatto Elsa? - Sì, perché?
[Olaf. Did you Elsa? - Yes because?]

00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,759
Do you know where she is? - Yeah. Why?
Tu sai dove? - Sì, perché?
[Do you know where? - Yes because?]

00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,919
Fascinating.

00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,681
Do you think you could show us the way? - Yeah. Why?
Puoi indicarci la strada? - Sì, perché?
[You can show us the way? - Yes because?]

00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,119
How does this work? Ow!
Come funziona?
[How does it work?]

00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,359
Stop it, Sven. Trying to focus, here.
??? devo concentrarmi.
[??? I have to focus.]

00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,562
Yeah. Why? - I'll tell you why.
Sì, perché? - Te lo dico io perché.
[Yes because? - I'll tell you why.]

00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,645
We need Elsa to bring back summer.
Elsa deve far tornare l'estate.
[Elsa must bring back the summer.]

00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,519
Summer?
L'estate?
[Summer?]

00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,839
Oh. I don't know why,
Non so perché...
[I do not know why...]

00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,599
but I've always loved the idea of summer
ma ho sempre amato l'idea dell'estate.
[but I've always loved the idea of the summer.]

00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,199
and sun, and all things hot.
E il sole, il caldo afoso.
[And the sun, the sultry heat.]

00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,279
Really?
Davvero?
Really?

00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,839
I'm guessing you don't have much experience with heat.
Mi sa che non hai molta familiarità col caldo!
I think that you don't have so much familiarity with heat!

00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,121
Nope.
No!
Nope!

00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,759
But sometimes I like to close my eyes,
Ma a volte amo chiudere gli occhi
But sometimes I love to close my eyes

00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,806
and imagine what it would be like when summer does come.
e immaginare come sarebbe se venisse l'Estate!
and to imagine how it would be if Summer came!

00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:50,119
Bees will buzz, kids will blow dandelion fuzz
Basta che l'ape svolazzi accanto a me
It is enough that the bee flutters next to me

00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:55,087
And I'll be doing whatever snow does in summer
ed io ricordo in un attimo quel che amo!
and I remember in a moment what I love!

00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,839
A drink in my hand
Un drink? Lo vorrei!
A drink? I would!

00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,239
My snow up against the burning sand
Magari anch'io mi abbronzarsi!
Perhaps I would tan too!

00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,519
Probably getting gorgeously tanned
Penso all'estate perché...
I think of the summer because...

00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,290
In summer.
... la amo!
... I love it!

00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,879
I'll finally see a summer breeze
Le onde, il mare, la marea,
The waves, the sea, the tide,

00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,999
Blow away a winter storm
e poi, caldo a volontà!
and then, heat at will!

00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,279
And find out what happens to solid water
Se il sole si incontra col ghiaccio freddo
If the sun meets with the cold ice

00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,211
When it gets warm
chissà che fa?
who knows what will happen?

00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,999
And I can't wait to see
E lo sai credo che...
And you know, I think...

00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,043
What my buddies all think of me
... guarderebbero tutti me
... everyone will watch me

00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,799
Just imagine how much cooler I'll be
Il mio sex-appeal dà il meglio di sè
My sex-appeal gives the best of itself

00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,207
In summer!
d'Estate!
in Summer!

00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,679
The hot and the cold are both so intense
Uniamo il freddo ed il caldo intenso,
Let's combine the cold and the intense heat,

00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,247
Put them together It just makes sense
ecco un'idea che ha davvero senso!
here's an idea that really makes sense!

00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,679
Winter's a good time to stay in and cuddle
Solo d'Estate il mio cuore si scalda,
Only in Summer my heart warms,

00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,223
But put me in summer and I'll be a...
la gioia che provo pensandoci
but I'd be merrily thinking of

00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,520
<i>(puddle?)</i>
<i>(cadulda?)</i>
<i>(melted ice?)</i>

00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,599
Happy snowman!
è enorme!
being huge!

00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,879
When life gets rough
E' questo il sogno
This is the dream

00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,401
I like to hold on to my dream
che mi piace da morire;
that I love;

00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:55,407
Of relaxing in the summer sun, just letting off steam
Ti rilassa e poi ti aiuta un pò se vuoi sbollire!
It relaxes you and then helps you a bit if you want to cool down!

00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,285
Oh, the sky will be blue
Sole caldo su di noi
Hot sun is on us

00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,724
And you guys will be there, too
ci sareste anche voi!
you would be there too!

00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,679
When I finally do
Un'estate da Re
A Royal Summer

00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:09,168
What frozen things do in summer!
da vivere in tre, insieme!
the three of us living together!

00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:10,884
I'm gonna tell him.
Io glielo dico.
I'm going to tell him.

00:49:10,885 --> 00:49:11,884
Don't you dare.
Non ci provare!
Don't try!

00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,687
In summer!
Insieme!
Together!

00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,559
So, come on! Elsa's this way.

00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,759
Let's go bring back summer!
??? far tornare l'estate!
[??? bring back the summer!]

00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,200
I'm coming!
Arrivo!
[Arrival!]

00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,525
Somebody's gotta tell him.
Qualcuno glielo deve dire!
[Someone has to tell him!]

00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,039
No, no. You've got the bark facing down.
No, hai messo la corteccia in giù.
[No, you put down the bark.]

00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,765
The bark needs to be face-up.
La corteccia deve stare in su.
[The bark should be up.]

00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,239
Bark down is drier. - Bark up!
In giù secca meglio. - Corteccia in su!
[Down dry better. - Bark up!]

00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,279
Bark down! - Papa!
Corteccia in giù! - Papa!
[Bark down! - Papa!]

00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,999
Cloak? Does anyone need a cloak?
Una coperta. A chi serve una coperta?
[A blanket. Who needs a blanket?]

00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,199
Arendelle is indebted to you, Your Highness.
Arendelle è in debito con voi.
[Arendelle is in your debt.]

00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,559
The castle is open.
Il castello è aperto.
[The castle is open.]

00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,479
Prince Hans!
Principe Hans!
[Prince Hans!]

00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,999
Are we expected to just sit here and freeze
Volete che restiamo qui a gelare...
[You want us to stay here to freeze...]

00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,646
while you give away all of Arendelle's tradable goods?
mentre voi regalate tutti i beni di Arendelle?
[while you give away all the goods Arendelle?]

00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,399
Princess Anna has given her orders.
La principessa ha dato ordini...
[The princess gave orders...]

00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,199
And that's another thing!
E c'è anche questo!
[And there is also this!]

00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,799
Has it dawned on you that your princess may be conspiring
Non avete pensato che la principessa potrebbe cospirare...
[You did not think that the princess could conspire...]

00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,119
with a wicked sorceress
con quella strega...
[with that witch...]

00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,199
to destroy us all?
per distruggerci tutti?
[to destroy us all?]

00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,970
Do not question the princess.
Non dubitate della principessa.
[Do not doubt the princess.]

00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,479
She left me in charge
Mi ha lasciato in carica...

E io proteggerò

to protect Arendelle from treason.
Arendelle dal tradimento.
[Arendelle betrayal.]

00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,279
Treason?
Tradimento?
[Treason?]

00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:23,719
Whoa! Whoa!

00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,519
Whoa, boy. Easy.
Oh, buono!
[Oh, good!]

00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,801
Easy.
Buono.

00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,120
It's Princess Anna's horse.
È il cavallo della principessa Anna.

00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,925
So, where is the princess?

Princess Anna is in trouble.

you are to put an end to this winter.
ponete fine a questo inverno.
[Place an end to this winter.]

00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,091
Do you understand?
Mi sono spiegato?
[I make myself clear?]

00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,205
So, how exactly are you planning to stop this weather?
E come pensi di far cambiare questo tempaccio?
[And how do you plan to change this weather?]

00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,081
Oh. I am gonna talk to my sister.
Ehh... intendo parlerò con mia sorella.

00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,766
Yep.
Sì.
[Yes.]

00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,885
So, you're not at all afraid of her?
Così, non hai paura di lei?
[So, are not you afraid of her?]

00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,090
Why would I be?
Perché dovrei?

It's too steep.

I've only got one rope and you don't know how to climb mountains.
Ho solo una fune, e tu non sai scalare le montagne.
[I only have a rope, and you do not know mountain climbing.]

00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,679
Says who?
E chi lo dice?
[Says who?]

00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,120
Hmm?

00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,561
What are you doing?

You're gonna kill yourself.
Ti ucciderai, cosi.
[You'll kill yourself, so.]

00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,839
I wouldn't put my foot there.
Non metterei il piede lì.
[I do not put your foot there.]

00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,690
You're distracting me. - Or there.
Mi distrai. - Neanche lì.
[I get distracted. - Not there.]

00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,639
How do you know Elsa even wants to see you?
Come sai che Elsa vorrà vederti?
[How do you know Elsa wants to see you?]

Except maybe you.
A parte forse te.
[Except maybe you.]

00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,649
I'm not alone. I have friends, remember?
Io non sono solo. Ho amici, ricordi?

00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,119
Hang on.
Resisti.
[Hold on.]

00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,321
Hey, Sven?

00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,239
Not sure if this is gonna solve the problem,
Non so se risolve il problema...
[I do not know if it solves the problem...]

00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,279
but I found a staircase that leads exactly
Ma ho trovato una scala che porta...

Dove vogliamo andare.
[Where we want to go.]

00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,599
Ha-ha! Thank goodness. Catch!
Grazie al cielo. Prendimi!
[Thank goodness. Take me!]

00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,886
Thanks. That was like a crazy trust exercise.
Grazie. È stata una folle prova di fiducia.
[Thank you. It was a crazy proof of confidence.]

00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,759

Go ahead. I won't judge.

[???. I do not judge.]

00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,759
All right, take it easy, boy. Come here.

00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,485
I got you.
Ci penso io.
[I got it.]

00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,327
Okay. You stay right here, buddy.
Tu resta qui, Sven.
[You stay here, Sven.]

00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,606
Flawless.
È perfetta.
[It's perfect.]

00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,881
Knock.
Bussa.
[Knocks.]

00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,211
Just knock.
??? bussa.
[??? knocks.]

00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,770
Why isn't she knocking?
Perché non bussa?
[Why do not you knock?]

00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,165
Do you think she knows how to knock?
Credi che sappia bussare?
[You think he knows knock?]

00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,959
Huh. It opened.
È aperto.
[It's open.]

00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,446
That's a first.
Mai successo.
[Never happened.]

00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,519
Oh. You should probably wait out here.
Tu aspetti fuori.
[You wait outside.]

00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,639
What? - The last time I introduced her to a guy,
Che cosa? - Quando gli ho presentato un ragazzo
[What? - When I presented him with a boy]

00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,999
she froze everything.
ha congelato tutto.
[It froze everything.]

00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,919
But, but... Oh, come on!
Ma...
[But...]

00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,885
It's a palace made of ice. Ice is my life!
È un palazzo di ghiaccio. Il ghiaccio è la mia vita.
[It's an ice palace. Ice is my life.]

00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:43,999
Bye, Sven.
Addio, Sven.
[Farewell, Sven.]

00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,770
You, too, Olaf.
Anche tu, Olaf.
[You too, Olaf.]

00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,929
Me? - Just give us a minute.
Anche io? - ??? solo minuto.
[Me too? - ??? minute.]

00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,526
Okay.
Va bene.
[All right.]

00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,290
One, two, three...
Uno, due, tre...
[One two three...]

00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,724
Four...
Quattro...
[Four...]

00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,281
Whoa.

00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,561
Elsa?

00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,443
It's me, Anna.
Sono io, Anna.
[It's me, Anna.]

00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,965
Anna.

00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:23,162
Whoa. Elsa, you look different.
Elsa, sei cambiata.
[Elsa, you've changed.]

00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,290
It's a good different.
In meglio, davvero.
[For the better, really.]

00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,926
And this place...
E questo posto...
[And this place...]

00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,566
It's amazing.
È meraviglioso!
[It's wonderful!]

00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:29,881
Thank you.
Grazie.
[Thank you.]

00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,282
I never knew what I was capable of.
Non sapevo di cosa fossi capace.
[I did not know what I was capable.]

00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,479
I'm so sorry about what happened. If I'd have known...
Mi dispiace tanto per quanto è accaduto.
[I'm so sorry for what happened.]

00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,806
No, no, no. It's okay.
No, no, va tutto bene.
[No, no, everything's fine.]

00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:41,090
You don't have to apologize, but you should probably go.
Non devi scusarti, ma dovresti andare.
[You do not apologize, but you should go.]

00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,879
Please.
Ti prego.
[Please.]

00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,241
But I just got here.
Sono arrivata ora.
[I came now.]

00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,564
You belong down in Arendelle.
Il tuo posto è ad Arendelle.
[It belongs to Arendelle.]

00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,879
So do you.
Anche il tuo.
[Even your.]

00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,208
No, Anna, I belong here.
No, Anna. Il mio posto è qui.
[No, Anna. My place is here.]

00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,401
Alone.
Da sola.
[Alone.]

00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:56,850
Where I can be who I am without hurting anybody.
Dove posso essere come sono senza far male a nessuno.
[Where I can be as I am not hurting anyone.]

00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,083
Actually, about that...
Veramente, a proposito di questo...
[Really, about this...]

00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,370
Sixty! - Wait. What is that?
??? - Aspetta, ???
[??? - Wait, ???]

00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,526
Hi! I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs!
Ciao, io sono Olaf e amo i caldi abbracci!
[Hello, I'm Olaf and I love the warm hug!]

00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,367
Olaf?

00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,281
You built me.
Sì, mi hai fatto tu.
[Yes, you've done you.]

00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,041
Remember that?
Te lo ricordi?
[Do you remember?]

00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,647
And you're alive?
E sei vivo?
[And you're alive?]

00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,602
Um... I think so.
Credo di sì.
[I think so.]

00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,686
He's just like the one we built as kids.
Sempre quello che abbiamo fatto da piccole.
[Always what we did small.]

00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,046
Yeah.
Sì.
[Yes.]

00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,449
Elsa, we were so close.
Elsa, eravamo così unite.
[Elsa, we were so united.]

00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,524
We can be like that again.
Potremmo esserlo ancora.
[We may be still.]

00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,480
Catch me! Slow down!
Prendimi! ???
[Take me! ???]

00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,161
Anna!

00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:36,759
No.

00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,440
We can't. Goodbye, Anna.
Non possiamo. Addio, Anna.
[We can not. Goodbye, Anna.]

00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,559
Elsa, wait.
Elsa, aspetta.
[Elsa, wait.]

00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,759
No, I'm just trying to protect you.
Voglio solo proteggerti.
[I just want to protect you.]

00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,611
You don't have to protect me. I'm not afraid.
Non devi proteggermi, io non ho paura.
You don't have to protect me, I'm not afraid.

00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,283
Please don't shut me out again.
Non escludermi di nuovo dalla tua vita.
Don't cut me off from your life again.

00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,519
Please don't slam the door
Dai, non dirmi no
Come on, don't tell me no

00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:54,599
You don't have to keep your distance anymore
Non dovrai scappare adesso che lo so
You won't have to run away now that I know

00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,610
'Cause for the first time in forever
Posso aiutarti per davvero
I can really help you

00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,799
I finally understand
Tu fidati di me
Just trust me

00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,159
For the first time in forever
Tutto quello che volevo
All I wanted

00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,439
We can fix this hand in hand
Era stare accanto a te
Was to stay by you

00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,608
We can head down this mountain together.
Insieme risolveremo tutto
We'll settle everything together

00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:09,639
You don't have to live in fear
E vedrai, sarà così
And you'll see, that's how it's going to be

00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:13,561
'Cause for the first time in forever
Tutto è diverso perché adesso
Everything is different because now

00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:16,919
I will be right here
Hai un'amica qui.
You've got a friend here.

00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,199
<i>Anna.</i>
<i>Anna...</i>
<i>Anna...</i>

00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,119
<i>Please go back home</i>
<i>Mi domandi troppo,</i>
<i>You're asking too much of me,</i>

00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,890
<i>Your life awaits</i>
<i>dai retta a me</i>
<i>listen to me</i>

00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,239
<i>Go enjoy the sun, and open up the gates</i>
<i>Non c'è nulla qua per una coma te</i>
<i>There's nothing here for someone like you</i>

00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,350
Yeah, but...
Sì, ma...
Yes, but...

00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:27,719
<i>I know.</i>
<i>Lo so</i>
<i>I know</i>

00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:32,050
<i>You mean well, but leave me be</i>
<i>Tu pensi che mi aiuterai</i>
<i>You think you're going to help me</i>

00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,559
<i>Yes, I'm alone</i>
<i>Ma senza me...</i>
<i>But without me...</i>

00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,519
<i>But I'm alone and free</i>
<i>... problemi non ne avrai</i>
<i>... you'll have no problems</i>

00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:41,282
<i>Just stay away and you'll be safe from me</i>
<i>E non dovrai più preoccuparti ormai</i>
<i>And you won't need to worry any more</i>

00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,521
Actually, we're not
Sai, non è così
Well, this isn't the way it is

00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:44,950
<i>What do you mean, you're not?</i>
<i>Come non è così?</i>
<i>What do you mean, this isn't the way it is?</i>

00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,450
I get the feeling you don't know
Non puoi saperlo neanche tu
Not even you can know it

00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,681
<i>What do I not know?</i>
<i>Parla, forza, su!</i>
<i>Speak out, come on!</i>

00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,399
Arendelle's in deep, deep, deep
Lì la neve è sempre, sempre, sempre, sempre
The snow is getting always, always, always, always...

00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,682
deep snow
... di più
... more

00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,041
<i>What?</i>
<i>Cosa?</i>
<i>What?</i>

00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:59,002
You kind of set off an eternal winter everywhere.
Hai portato un inverno perenne... ovunque
You've brought a perpetual winter... everywhere

00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,359
<i>Everywhere?</i>
<i>Ovunque?</i>
<i>Everywhere?</i>

00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,279
Well, it's okay, you can just unfreeze it.
Ma non fa niente, puoi sciogliere tutto
But it doesn't matter, you can thaw everything out

00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,528
<i>No, I can't. I don't know how.</i>
<i>No, non posso. Non so come fare!</i>
<i>No, I can't. I don't know how!</i>

00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,081
Sure you can. I know you can.
Certo che puoi. Io so che puoi.
Sure you can. I know you can.

00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:12,401
'Cause for the first time in forever
Avrò la forza per restare
I'll have the strength to stay

00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:15,519
<i>Oh, I'm such a fool! I can't be free!</i>
<i>Non avrò mai la libertà!</i>
<i>I'll never have my freedom!</i>

00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:17,950
You don't have to be afraid
Non dovrai scappare, sai
You won't have to run away, you know

00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,839
<i>No escape from the storm inside of me</i>
<i>Sono in trappola e nulla cambierà</i>
<i>I'm trapped and nothing will change</i>

00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:21,839
We can work this out together
Sul mio aiuto puoi contare
You can rely on my help

00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,819
<i>I can't control the curse!</i>
<i>Che faccio d'ora io poi?</i>
<i>What shall I do from now on?</i>

00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,639
We'll reverse the storm you've made
Non sei più da sola ormai
You're no longer alone

00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:29,219
<i>Anna, please you'll only make it worse!</i>
<i>Anna, vuoi salvarmi ma non puoi!</i>
<i>Anna, you want to save me but you can't!</i>

00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,019
Don't panic!
Tranquilla
Don't worry

00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:31,319
<i>There's so much fear!</i>
<i>È colpa mia!</i>
<i>It's my fault!</i>

00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:33,919
We'll make the sun shine bright
Vedrai, funzionerà
You'll see, it's going to work

00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:35,319
<i>You're not safe here!</i>
<i>Non c'è altra via!</i>
<i>There's no other way!</i>

00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:37,119
We can face this thing together
Se le forze uniremo
If we join our forces

00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:38,119
<i>No!</i>
<i>No!</i>
<i>No!</i>

00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,279
We can change this winter weather
So che noi ci riusciremo
I know we can make it

00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,768
And everything will be all right
E la bufera passerà
And the storm will blow over

00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,761
<i>I can't!</i>
<i>Vai via!</i>
<i>Begone!</i>

00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,441
Anna!

00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,201
Are you okay?

00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,479
I'm okay.
Sto bene.
[I'm fine.]

00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,920
I'm fine.
Sto bene.
[I'm fine.]

00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,159
Who's this?
Chi è lui?
[Who is he?]

00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,771
Wait, it doesn't matter. Just...
Aspetta, non importa. Solo...
[Wait, never mind. Only...]

00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,199
You have to go.
Andate via.
[Go away.]

00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,999
No, I know we can figure this out together.
No, so che insieme lo risolveremo.
[No, I know that together we will solve it.]

00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,079
How?
Come?
[How?]

00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,442
What power do you have to stop this winter?
Che potere hai per fermare questo inverno?
[What power you have to stop this winter?]

00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,046
To stop me?
Per fermare me?
[To stop me?]

00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,559
Anna, I think we should go.

00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,559
No, I'm not leaving without you, Elsa.
Non vado via senza di te, Elsa.
[I do not go away without you, Elsa.]

00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,444
Yes, you are.
Sì, invece ???.
[Yes but ???.]

00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,799
Stop! Put us down!
Fermo! Mettici giù!
[Stop! Put us down!]

00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,604
Go away.
Andate via.
[Go away.]

00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,565
Heads up!
Occhio!
[Eye!]

00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,439
Watch out for my butt!
Chiappette arriva!
[My behind's coming in!]

00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,959
It is not nice to throw people!
Non è carino lanciare la gente!
[Not nice throw people!]

00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,199
Whoa, whoa, whoa, feisty-pants. Okay, relax.
Ehi, furia scatenata.
[Hey, fury.]

00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,599
Just calm down! Calm down! - Okay! All right!
Calmati! - Va bene!
[Calm down! - All right!]

00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,279
I'm okay. - Just let the snowman be.
Sto bene. - Lascia stare il pupazzo di neve.
[I'm fine. - Leave the snowman.]

00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,599
I'm calm.
Sono calma.
[I am calm.]

00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,325
Oh! Come on!

00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,839
Oh. Look, see? Now you made him mad.
Visto? L'hai fatto arrabbiare!
[See? You've angered!]

00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,804
I'll distract him. You guys go.
Io lo distraggo. Voi andate.
[I get distracted. You go.]

00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,331
No, no! Not you guys!
No, no! Non voi due!
[No no! Not you two!]

00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,480
This just got a whole lot harder.

00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,321
Look out!
Attenzione!
[Attention!]

00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,763
What are you doing?
Che cosa fai?
[What do you do?]

00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,441
I got him!

00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,159
Whoa! Stop!
Ferma!
[Stop!]

00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,407
It's a hundred-foot drop.
È un salto di trenta metri.
[It is a leap of thirty meters.]

00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,007
It's two hundred.
??? sessanta.
[??? sixty.]

00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,521
Ow!

00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,199
What's that for? - I'm digging a snow anchor.
Che fai? - Un ancoraggio.
[What are you doing? - An anchor.]

00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,890
Okay. What if we fall?
Certo. E se cadiamo?
[Sure. And if we fall?]

00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,119
There's 20 feet of fresh powder down there.
Ci sono cinque metri di neve fresca.
[There are five meters of fresh snow.]

00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,879
It'll be like landing on a pillow.
Sarà come atterrare su un cuscino.
[It will be like landing on a pillow.]

00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:42,959
Hopefully.
Almeno spero.
[I hope.]

00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,199
Okay, Anna. On three.
Anna. Al tre.
[Anna. On three.]

00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,559
One...
Uno...
[One...]

00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:50,639
Okay. You tell me when. I'm ready to go.
Dammi il via. Sono pronta.
[Give me off. I'm ready.]

00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,279
Two... - I was born ready! Yes!
Due... Sono nata pronta.
[Two... I was born ready.]

00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,561
Calm down.
Calmati.
[Calm down.]

00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,679
Tree!
Via!
[Via!]

00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,961
What the... Whoa!
Ma che?
[But who?]

00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,604
That happened.
È andata.
[It's gone.]

01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,519
Man, am I out of shape.
Mammina. Sono fuori forma.
[Mommy. I'm out of shape.]

01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,519
There we go. Hey, Anna!
Ecco fatto. Anna!
[Done. Anna!]

01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,359
Sven! Where did you guys go?
Sven! Dove siete?
[Sven! Where are you?]

01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,211
We totally lost Marshmallow back there.
???
[???]

01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,039
Hey! We were just talking about you.

01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,208
All good things, all good things.
Solo cose belle, solo cose belle.
[Only good things, only good things.]

01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:23,721
No!

01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,199
This is not making much of a difference, is it?
Non fa differenza per te, vero?
[It makes no difference to you, right?]

01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,799
Olaf!

01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,764
Hang in there, guys!
Tenete duro!
[Hold on!]

01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:35,959
Go. Go faster!
Più veloce!
[Faster!]

01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,810
Wait, what?
Aspetta, che?
[Wait, what?]

01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,599
Ow!

01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,079
Kristoff!

01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,808
Don't come back!
Non tornate più!
[Do not go back more!]

01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,521
We won't.
???
[???]

01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,484
Hey, you were right. Just like a pillow.
Avevi ragione. Come su un cuscino.
[You were right. How about a pillow.]

01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:04,886
Olaf!

01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,999
I can't feel my legs! I can't feel my legs!
Non mi sento più le gambe!
[I do not feel my legs!]

01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,559
Those are my legs.
Quelle sono le mie gambe.
[Those are my legs.]

01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,079
Oooh. Hey, do me a favor, grab my butt.
Mi acchiappi le chiappe?
[I catch me your ass?]

01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,169
Oh. That feels better.
Va meglio!
[It goes better!]

01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,921
Hey, Sven! He found us.
Sven! Ci ha trovati!
[Sven! He found us!]

01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,159
Who's my cute little reindeer?
La mia rennetta dolce!
[My rennetta sweet!]

01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,279
Don't talk to him like that.
Non parlargli così!
[Do not talk like that!]

01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,164
You're tickling me.
Che solletico!
[That tickles!]

01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,281
Here.

01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:27,599
Whoa!

01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,799
Are you okay?
Tutto bene?
[All right?]

01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,365
Thank you.
Grazie.
[Thank you.]

01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,526
How's your head? - Ah! Ooh!
Come va la testa?
[How's your head?]

01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,439
It's fine. Uh...
Va bene.
[All right.]

01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,119
Uh, I'm good. I've got a thick skull.
Tranquillo. Ho il cranio tosto.
[Quiet. I have the skull soon.]

01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:39,129
I don't have a skull.
Io non ho il cranio.
[I do not have the skull.]

01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:40,921
Or bones.
Né le ossa.
[Neither the bones.]

01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,641
So, uh... So, now what?
E ora... che si fa?
[And now... what?]

01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,799
Now what?
Che si fa?
[What do you do?]

01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,199
Now what?

01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,481
Oh...

01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,040
What am I gonna do?
Che faccio io?
[What do I do?]

01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,839
She threw me out.
Mi ha cacciata via.
[He was thrown out.]

01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,199
I can't go back to Arendelle with the weather like this.
Non torno ad Arendelle con questo tempaccio.
[I get back to Arendelle in this weather.]

01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,279
And then there's your ice business.
E c'è il tuo commercio di ghiaccio.
[And there's your trade ice.]

01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,006
Hey, hey. Don't worry about my ice business.
???
[???]

01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,259
Worry about your hair!
Pensa ai tuoi capelli.
[Think about your hair.]

01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:02,639
What? I just fell off a cliff. You should see your hair.
Che? Sono caduta da una rupe. Dovresti vedere i tuoi. 
[What? I fell off a cliff. You should see your.]

01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,359
No, yours is turning white.
No, i tuoi diventano bianchi.
[No, you become white.]

01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:07,279
White? It's... What?
Bianchi? È... Che?
[Bianchi? Is That?]

01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,482
It's because she struck you, isn't it?
È perché ti ha colpita, vero?
[It's because he struck you, right?]

01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,690
Does it look bad?
Mi invecchiano?
[I get older?]

01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,039
No. - You hesitated.
No. - Hai esitato.
[No. - You hesitated.]

01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,287
No, I didn't.
Non è vero.
[It's not true.]

01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,559
Anna, you need help, okay? Come on.
Anna, ti serve aiuto. Andiamo.
[Anna, you need help. Come on.]

01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,250
Okay! Where are we going?
Dove andiamo?
[Where are we going?]

01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,359
To see my friends.
Dai miei amici.
[From my friends.]

01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,679
The love experts?
Gli esperti in amore?
[Experts in love?]

01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,530
Love experts?
Esperti in amore?
[Experts in love?]

01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,159
And don't worry, they'll be able to fix this.
E tranquilla. ???
[And quiet. ???]

01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,010
How do you know?
Come lo sai?
[How do you know that?]

01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,723
Because I've seen them do it before.
Gliel'ho già visto fare volta.
[I've already seen it done once.]

01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,159
I like to consider myself a love expert.
Amo considerarmi un esperto in amore.
[I love to consider myself an expert in love.]

01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,570
Get it together.
Cerca di dominarti.
[Tries to dominate you.]

01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,559
Control it.
Controllati.
[Controlled.]

01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,364
Don't feel. Don't feel.
Niente ???
[Nothing???]

01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,490
Don't feel.

01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:48,324
Don't feel!

01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,407
Look, Sven, the sky's awake.
Sven, il cielo è sveglio.
[Sven, the sky is awake.]

01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,569
Are you cold? - A little.
Hai freddo? - Un pochino.
[Are you cold? - A little.]

01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,959
Uh... Wait. Come here.
Aspetta. Vieni qui.
[Wait. Come here.]

01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,241
Huh?

01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,251
Ooh.

01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,919
So, uh, about my friends. Well...
I miei amici...
[My friends...]

01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,359
I say "friends"...
Dico "amici"...
[I say "friends"...]

01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,399
They're more like family.
ma sono la mia famiglia.
[but they are my family.]

01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,399
Anyway, when I was a kid, it was just me and Sven.
Da piccolo eravamo soli, Sven e io.
[As a child we were alone, Sven and me.]

01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,489
Until they, you know, kinda took us in.
Finché non ci hanno presi con loro.
[Until they have taken with them.]

01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,365
They did?
Davvero?
[Really?]

01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:34,679
Yeah. I don't want to scare you.
Sì! Non voglio spaventarti.
[Yes! I do not want to scare you.]

01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:39,119
They can be a little inappropriate and loud.
A volte sono sfacciati e chiassosi.
[Sometimes they are brash and boisterous.]

01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,685
Very loud.
Molto chiassosi.
[Very noisy.]

01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,679
They are also stubborn at times,
Sono anche testardi, talvolta.
[They are also stubborn, sometimes.]

01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:43,959
and a little overbearing.
E prepotenti.
[And bullies.]

01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,759
And heavy. Really, really, heavy.
E pesanti. Molto, molto pesanti.
[And heavy. Very, very heavy.]

01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,119
But you'll get it. They mean well.
Ma li capirai. Sono buoni.
[But you will understand. They are good.]

01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,448
Kristoff, they sound wonderful.

01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:54,971
Okay, then.
Bene, allora.
[Well then.]

01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,489
Meet my family.
Ti presento i miei.
[Meet the Parents.]

01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,401

01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,450
They're rocks.
Sono rocce.
[They are rocks.]

01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,799
You are a sight for sore eyes.

He's crazy. - Hey look, ???'s back from vacation!
È completamente pazzo.
[It's completely crazy.]

01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,488
Rocko's looking sharp, as usual.
Rocko, elegante, come sempre.
[Rocko, elegant, as always.]

01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,919
Clay, whoa... I don't even recognize you.
Clay, non ti riconoscevo.
[Clay, did not recognize you.]

01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,039
You lost so much weight.
Hai perso peso.
[You lost weight.]

01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,999
I'll distract him while you run.
Io lo distraggo tu scappa.
[I distracted you run.]

01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,123
Hi, Sven's family!
Ciao famiglia di Sven!
[Hello family of Sven!]

01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,801
It's nice to meet you.
Piacere!
[Pleasure!]

01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,439
Because I love you, Anna, I insist you run.
Per il tuo bene Anna, insisto: scappa!
[For your sake Anna, I insist: run!]

01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:27,531
I understand you're love experts. Ooh!
Si vede che siete esperti in amore.
[You see that you are experienced in love.]

01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,490
Why aren't you running?
Perché non scappi?
[Why do not you run away?]

01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:30,799
Uh...

01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,287
Okay. Well, I'm gonna go.
Certo. Io andrei...
[Sure. I would go...]

01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,444
No, no, no. Anna, wait.
No, Anna, aspetta.
[No, Anna, waiting.]

01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,490
Kristoff!

01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,444
Whoa!

01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,166
Hey!

Kristoff's home!
Kristoff è tornato!
[Kristoff is back!]

01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:49,839
Kristoff's here! Kristoff's home!

01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,319
Wait, "Kristoff"?
Aspetta. Kristoff?
[Wait. Kristoff?]

01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,799
Ah, let me look at you.
Fatti vedere.
[Show yourself.]

01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,479
Take off your clothes, I wash them.
Togli i vestiti, te li lavo.
[Take off your clothes, you wash them.]

01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,364
No! No, I'm going to keep my clothes on.
No, i vestiti me li tengo.
[No, the clothes I keep them.]

01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:58,799
Look, it's great to see you all,
È bello vedervi,
[It's nice to see you,]

01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,039
but where's Granpabbie?
ma dov'è Granpapà?
[but where Granpapà?]

01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:01,159
He's napping.

01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,959
But look, I grew a mushroom.
Mi è cresciuto un fungo.
[I grew a fungus.]

01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,559
I earned my fire crystal.
Ho avuto il cristallo di fuoco.
[I had a glass of fire.]

01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,000
I passed a kidney stone.
Ho espulso un calcolo.
[I expelled a calculation.]

01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,319
Kristoff, pick me up.
Prendimi Kristoff.
[Take Kristoff.]

01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,599
You're getting big.
-Sei cresciuto!
[-You Are grown!]

01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,881
Good for you.
Bravo!
[Good Boy!]

01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,568
Trolls. They're trolls!
Troll! Sono troll!
[Troll! Are trolls!]

01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,124
He's brought a girl!
Ha portato una donna!
[He brought a woman!]

01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,886
A girl!
Una donna!
[A woman!]

01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,759
Is that a real girl?

01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,879
She's like a little cupcake.
Sembra un cupcake!
[It looks like a cupcake!]

01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:23,959
What's going on?
Che succede?
[What happens?]

01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,286
I've learned to just roll with it.
Io li lascio fare.
[I let them do.]

01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,879
Let me see. Bright eyes, working nose,
Occhi brillanti, naso libero...
[Shining eyes, nose free...]

01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,411
strong teeth!
dentatura forte.
[teeth strong.]

01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:32,279
Yes, yes. She'll do nicely for our Kristoff.
Sì. Andrà bene per il nostro Kristoff.
[Yes. Will it fit our Kristoff.]

01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:33,519
Wait, wait, wait. Oh, um, no.
Aspetta. No.
[Wait. No.]

01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,919
You've got the wrong idea.

01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:36,079
No. That's not why I brought her here.

01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,959
Right. We're not... I'm not...
Sì. Noi non siamo... non sono...
[Yes. We are not... we are not...]

01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,159
What's the issue, dear?
Qual è il problema, tesoro?
[What's the matter, honey?]

01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:43,319
Why are you holding back from such a man?
Perché respingi un uomo simile?
[Why reject such a man?]

01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,329
Is it the clumpy way he walks?
Saltella sempre come un troll?
[Always jumps like a troll?]

01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:47,679
What? - Or the grumpy way he talks?
Che cosa? - Non gli piace il rock'n roll?
[What? - He does not like rock'n' roll?]

01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,479
Or the pear-shaped, square-shaped
Ha dei piedi grossi
[He has big feet]

01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,039
Weirdness of his feet?
quasi quanto me?
[almost as much as me?]

01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:52,159
Hey!
Ehi!
[Hey!]

01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,119
And though we know he washes well
Magari trovi disarmante
[Maybe you can find disarming]

01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,759
He always ends up sort of smelly
quell’odore un po' ruspante
[smell a little' free-range]

01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,399
But you'll never meet a fella
Ma un ragazzo più stupendo e
[But a boy more beautiful and]

01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,359
Who's as sensitive and sweet
dolce, credici, non c'è!
[sweet, believe us, there is!]

01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,479
That's nice, but...
Perfetto, ma...
[Perfect, but...]

01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:03,519
So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper
C'è qualche aspetto da sistemare,
[Is there anything to be fixed,]

01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,599
So, he's got a few flaws
ma ciascuno ne ha!
[but each one has!]

01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:06,839
Like his peculiar brain, dear
La fissazione perenne
[The perennial fixation]

01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:07,999
His thing with the reindeer
Che ha per le renne
[Who for reindeer]

01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,679
That's a little outside of nature's laws
Con un po' di pazienza passerà.
[With a little' patience will.]

01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:10,799
This is not about me!
Non parlano di me!
[Do not talk about me!]

01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,559
So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper
C'è qualche aspetto da sistemare,
[Is there anything to be fixed,]

01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,759
But this we're certain of
ma fidati di noi
[but trust us]

01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:17,399
You can fix this fixer-upper up
Ogni ostacolo si supera,
[Each obstacle is overcome,]

01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,199
With a little bit of love
Con l’amore tra di voi.
[With the love between you.]

01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,239
Can we please just stop talking about this?
Possiamo smettere di parlare di questo?
[Can we stop talking about this?]

01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,479
We've got a real, actual problem, here.
Abbiamo un problema più grave.
[We have a bigger problem.]

01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:26,081
I'll say. So, tell me, dear...
Direi. Allora, cara...
[I would say. So, dear...]

01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,359
Is it the way that he runs scared?
Sai che si caccia in mezzo ai guai?
[You know that you hunt in trouble?]

01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,449
Or that he's socially impaired?
O è perché non parla mai?
[Or is it because no one ever talks about?]

01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,879
Or that he only likes to tinkle in the woods?
La fa nel bosco quando non la tiene più.
[Ago in the woods when it holds more.]

01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:34,999
I did not need to know that.
Preferivo non saperlo.
[I preferred not to know.]

01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,239
Are you holding back your fondness
Forse non vuoi dargli un bacio,
[Maybe you do not want to kiss him,]

01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,719
Due to his unmanly blondness?
perché biondo è poco macho?
[because blonde is little macho?]

01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:43,403
Or the way he covers up that he's the honest goods?
O perché lui non si vanta delle sue virtù?
[Or because he does not boast of his virtues?]

01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,519
He's just a bit of a fixer-upper
C'è qualcosina da sistemare,
[There's a little something to fix,]

01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,039
He's got a couple of bugs
qualche difetto lo ha
[some fault him]

01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:50,919
(No, I don't!) - His isolation is confirmation
(No, per niente!) - È rattristato, l'ha confermato,
[(No, not at all!) - It's sad, he confirmed,]

01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:53,919
Of his desperation for healing hugs
cerca disperato un po' di umanità.
[looking a bit desperate' of humanity.]

01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,479
So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper
È molto meglio di quel che sembra,
[It is much better than it sounds,]

01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,239
But we know what to do
Lui ha una marcia in più!
[He has a plus!]

01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,279
The way to fix up this fixer-upper
Se pure qualcosa va cambiato,
[Even if something is changed,]

01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,839
Is to fix him up with you
Lo potrai cambiare tu!
[It can change you!]

01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,519
Whoa!

01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,165
Stop it, stop it, stop it! Enough!
Fermi, fermi. Basta ora!
[Still, still. Enough now!]

01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:08,366
She is engaged to someone else, okay?
È fidanzata con un altro, chiaro?
[It is engaged to another, right?]

01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,079
So, she's a bit of a fixer-upper
A quanto pare c'è un altro tipo
[Apparently there is another kind]

01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,009
That's a minor thing
Sembra sia così.
[It seems so.]

01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,479
Her quote "engagement" is a flex arrangement
Ho visto bene o non sono insieme?
[I saw well or are not together?]

01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,839
And by the way, I don't see no ring
E poi non ha nessun anello qui!
[He then has no ring here!]

01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:23,119
So, she's a bit of a fixer-upper
Il fidanzato va eliminato!
[The boyfriend must be eliminated!]

01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:25,322
Her brain's a bit betwixt
È semplice, perché,
[It's simple, because,]

01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,799
Get the fiance out of the way
se, con cortesia, lo cacci via,
[if, with courtesy, send him away,]

01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,121
And the whole thing will be fixed
il suo cuore è per te!
[his heart is for you!]

01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,959
We're not saying you can change him
Ma non credere che cambi,
[But do not think that changes,]

01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,049
'Cause people don't really change
vedrai che non accadrà.
[you'll see that it will not happen.]

01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,679
We're only saying that love's a force
Ma puoi scoprire che anche lui
[But you will find out that he]

01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:41,039
That's powerful and strange
ha molte qualita!
[It has many qualities!]

01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:43,279
People make bad choices
Spesso i nostri errori
[Often our mistakes]

01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,687
If they're mad or scared or stressed
ci procurano dei guai,
[cause us trouble,]

01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,799
But throw a little love their way
Ma chi ascolta il cuore sa
[But who listens to the heart knows]

01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,159
Throw a little love their way
Ma chi ascolta il cuore sa
[But who listens to the heart knows]

01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,283
And you'll bring out their best
Non si sbaglia mai
[Never wrong]

01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,688
True love brings out the best
Che non si sbaglia mai.
[That is never wrong.]

01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,367
Everyone's a bit of a fixer-upper
Qui non c'è nessuno che sia perfetto,
[Here no one is perfect,]

01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,319
That's what it's all about
Ecco la verità.
[That's the truth.]

01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,399
Father! Sister! Brother!
Padre! Figlia! Fratello!
[Father! Daughter! Brother!]

01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:04,199
We need each other to raise us up
È questo il bello!
[This is the beauty!]

01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,561
And round us out
L'amore ci completerà.
[Love will be completed.]

01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,959
Everyone's a bit of a fixer-upper
Qualche problemino lo trovi sempre,
[I always find some problems,]

01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:11,479
But when push comes to shove
Succede a tutti noi
[It happens to all of us]

01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:12,759
The only fixer-upper fixer
Con l'amore più profondo
[With the deepest love]

01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:13,839
That can fix a fixer-upper is...
puoi cambiare tutto il mondo se
[you can change the world if]

01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:17,279
True, true
Tu, tu
[You, you]

01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:18,399
True
Tu
[you]

01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,479
Love!
Vuoi!
[Do you want!]

01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:20,839
Love, love, love

01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:22,839
Love! True love
Solamente se...
[Only if...]

01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:23,999
True
Tu...
[You...]

01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,199
Do you, Anna, take Kristoff to be your trollfully wedded...
Vuoi tu Anna prendere Kristoff come tuo trollegittimo...
[Will you take Anna Kristoff as your troll-legitimate...]

01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,159
Wait, what? - You're getting married.
Aspetta, che? - Vi state sposando.
[Wait, what? - You're married.]

01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,319
Love!
... puoi!
[... You can!]

01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,601
Anna?

01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:34,806
She's as cold as ice.
È fredda come il ghiaccio.
[It's cold as ice.]

01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:39,170
There is strange magic here.
C'è una strana magia, qui.
[There is a strange magic, here.]

01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:42,563
Granpabbie. - Come, come. Bring her here to me.
Granpapà! - Presto, presto. Portala qui da me.
[Granpapà! - Hurry, hurry. Take it from me here.]

01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:46,725
Anna, your life is in danger.
Anna, la tua vita è in pericolo.
[Anna, your life is in danger.]

01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:50,324
There is ice in your heart put there by your sister.
Tua sorella ha messo ghiaccio nel tuo cuore.
[Your sister put ice in your heart.]

01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:55,648
If not removed, to solid ice will you freeze, forever.
Se non viene tolto, il ghiaccio ti congelerà. Per sempre.
[If not removed, the ice will freeze. Forever.]

01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,239
What? No.
Cosa? No.
[What? No.]

01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,679
But you can remove it, right?
Ma tu puoi toglierlo, vero?
[But you can take it off, right?]

01:08:58,680 --> 01:08:59,879
I cannot
Non posso.
[I can not.]

01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,889
I'm sorry, Kristoff.
Mi dispiace, Kristoff.
[Sorry, Kristoff.]

01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,399
If it was her head, that would be easy.
Se fosse nella testa, sarebbe facile.
[If it was in my head, it would be easy.]

01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:09,401
But only an act of true love can thaw a frozen heart.
Ma solo un atto di vero amore scioglie un cuore di ghiaccio.
[But only an act of true love melt a heart of ice.]

01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,679
An act of true love?
Un atto di vero amore?
[An act of true love?]

01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:14,167
A true love's kiss, perhaps?
Il bacio del vero amore, magari?
[The kiss of true love, maybe?]

01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:20,279
(Something's wrong. Are you all right?)

01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,879
Anna, we've got to get you back to Hans.
Anna, dobbiamo riportarti da Hans.
[Anna, we have to bring you back to Hans.]

01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:23,999
Hans.

01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,201
Pull us out, Sven.
Tiraci fuori, Sven.
[Get us out, Sven.]

01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,359
Olaf, come on!
Olaf, andiamo!
[Olaf, come on!]

01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:31,085
I'm coming!
Ecco mi!
[That's me!]

01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,363
Let's go kiss Hans!
Andiamo a baciare Hans!
[We're going to kiss Hans!]

01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,484
Who is this Hans?
A chi è questo Hans?
[Who is this Hans?]

01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,489
We are here to find Princess Anna.
Siamo qui per la principessa Anna.
[We are here to Princess Anne.]

01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:51,442
Be on guard, but no harm is to come to the queen.
State in guardia, ma nessuno tocchi la regina.
[Be on guard, but nobody touches the queen.]

01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:53,879
Do you understand?
Sono stato è chiaro?
[I was clear?]

01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:55,880
Yes, Your Grace.

01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,491
The queen.
La regina.
[Queen.]

01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,568
Go, go! Come on!
Via, via! Andiamo!
[Away! Come on!]

01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:29,887
There!

01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,567
Up there!
Lassù!
[Up there!]

01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,325
Come on!
Andiamo!
[Come on!]

01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,081
We got her.
Eccola!
[Here it is!]

01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,920
No. Please.
No, vi prego.
[No, please.]

01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,530
Go around. Toss it.
Dall'altra parte. Prendi.
[On the other side. Get.]

01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,886
Stay away!
State lontani!
[Stay away!]

01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,326
Look out!
Attenzione!
[Attention!]

01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,839
Fire! Fire!
Fuoco! Fuoco!
[Fire! Fire!]

01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,246
Get her!

01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,321
Ah!

01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,926
Come on!
Andiamo!
[Come on!]

01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,007
Grab his arm.

01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,441
Aim...

01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,239
This way, this way!

01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:48,441
Whoa!

01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:51,847
Queen Elsa!
Regina Elsa!
[Queen Elsa!]

01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,761
Don't be the monster they fear you are.
Non siate il mostro che tutti temono.
[Do not be the monster that everyone fears.]

01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,927
Oh, no. What have... What have I done?
Oh, no. Che cosa ho fatto?
[Oh no. What have I done?]

01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,491
Why did you bring me here?
Perché mi hai portata qui?
[Why did you bring me here?]

01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,439
I couldn't just let them kill you.
Non potevo farvi uccidere.
[I could not kill you.]

01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,769
But I'm a danger to Arendelle. Get Anna.
Ma io sono un pericolo per Arendelle. Va' da Anna.
[But I'm a danger to Arendelle. Goes' from Anna.]

01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,199
Anna has not returned.
Anna non è tornata.
[Anna has not returned.]

01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,048
If you would just stop the winter.
Maestà, ??? l'inverno.
[Majesty,??? winter.]

01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,846
Bring back summer, please.
Riportate l'estate. Vi prego.
[Given the summer. Please.]

01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,645
Don't you see?
Non vedi?
[Do not you see?]

01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,280
I can't.
Non posso.
[I can not.]

01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:18,281
You have to tell them to let me go.
Digli di lasciarmi andare.
[Tell him to let me go.]

01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,889
I will do what I can.
Farò il possibile.
[I will do my best.]

01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:46,999
Just hang in there.
Resisti.
[Hold on.]

01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,361
Come on, buddy, faster!
Forza, Sven, più veloce!
[Strength, Sven, faster!]

01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,359
Oh, boy!
Oh, mammina.
[Oh, Mommy.]

01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,562
Whoa! I'll meet you guys at the castle!
Ci vediamo al castello!
[See you at the castle!]

01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:58,999
Stay out of sight, Olaf.
Sta' nascosto, Olaf.
[Is' hidden, Olaf.]

01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,725
I will!
Sarà fatto!
[It will be done!]

01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:04,161
Hello! - It's alive!

01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,725
It's Princess Anna!
È la principessa Anna.
[Is Princess Anne.]

01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,969
Are you gonna be okay?
Tu, starai bene?
[You, you'll be fine?]

01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,679
Don't worry about me.
Non pensare a me.
[Do not think about me.]

01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:30,519
Anna!

01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,439
You had us worried sick. My Lady.

01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:35,439
Get her warm. And find Prince Hans, immediately.
Tenete al caldo. E trovate il principe Hans, subito.
[Keep warm. And find Prince Hans, immediately.]

01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,051
We will. Thank you.
Lo faremo. Grazie.
[We will do it. Thank you.]

01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,731
Make sure she's safe.

01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,679
Oh, you poor girl, you're freezing.
Povera piccola, siete gelata.
[Poor child, you are frozen.]

01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:44,089
Oh, let's get you inside now and get you warm.

01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:59,399
I'm going back out to look for Princess Anna.

01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,250
You cannot risk going out there again.
Non potete rischiare.
[You can not risk it.]

01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:02,599
If anything happens to her...
Se le accadesse qualcosa...
[If something happened...]

01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,564
If anything happens to the princess,
Se accade qualcosa alla Principessa...
[If something happens to the Princess...]

01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:07,127
you are all Arendelle has left.
ad Arendelle non rimarrete che voi.
[to Arendelle that you will not be.]

01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:10,519
He's in here.
Principe è qui.
[Prince is here.]

01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:11,639
Prince Hans.
Principe Hans.
[Prince Hans.]

01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,079
Anna.

01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,199
You're so cold.
Sei ghiacciata.
[Six iced.]

01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,439
Hans, you have to kiss me. - What?
Hans devi baciarmi. - Che cosa?
[Hans have to kiss me. - What?]

01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,159
Now! Now! - Slow down.
Subito, subito!
[Immediately, immediately!]

01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:19,089
We'll give you two some privacy.
Vi lasciamo soli un momento.
[We leave you just a moment.]

01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,039
What happened out there?
Cosa è successo?
[What happened?]

01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,129
Elsa struck me with her powers.
Elsa mi ha colpita con i suoi poteri.
[Elsa hit me with his powers.]

01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,679
You said she'd never hurt you.
Dicevi che non ti avrebbe fatto nulla.
[You said you would not have done anything.]

01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:25,759
I was wrong.

01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,325
Anna.

01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,690
She froze my heart,
Mi ha gelato il cuore.
[I froze my heart.]

01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:34,366
and only an act of true love can save me.
Solo un atto di vero amore può salvarmi.
[Only an act of true love can save me.]

01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,804
A true love's kiss.
Il bacio del vero amore!
[The kiss of true love!]

01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:49,160
Oh, Anna.

01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:53,559
If only there was someone out there who loved you.

01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:55,000
What?

01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,284
You said you did.

01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:04,199
As thirteenth in line in my own kingdom,

01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,479
I didn't stand a chance.

01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:09,239
I knew I would have to marry into the throne somewhere.

01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,805
What... What are you talking about?

01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,767
As heir, Elsa was preferable, of course.

01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,839
But no one was getting anywhere with her.

01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:16,919
But you...

01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,439
You were so desperate for love,

01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:21,371
you were willing to marry me just like that.

01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,639
I figured after we married,

01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,799
I would have to stage a little accident for Elsa.

01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,048
Hans! No. Stop.

01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:31,159
But then, she doomed herself,

01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:33,119
and you were dumb enough to go after her.

01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,239
Please.

01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:36,920
All that's left now is to kill Elsa,

01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:38,971
and bring back summer.

01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,439
You're no match for Elsa.

01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,847
No, you're no match for Elsa.

01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:45,681
I, on the other hand,

01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:50,729
am the hero who is going to save Arendelle from destruction.

01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,011
You won't get away with this.

01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,607
Oh...

01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,811
I already have.

01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,324
Please, somebody, help.

01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,123
Please. Please.

01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,999
It's getting colder by the minute.

01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,719
If we don't do something soon, we'll all freeze to death.

01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:20,331
Prince Hans.

01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,443
Princess Anna is...

01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,239
Dead.

01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:25,319
What?

01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:27,010
What happened to her?

01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:33,450
She was killed...

01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,079
... by Queen Elsa.

01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:36,327
No!

01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,681
Her own sister.

01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,967
At least we got to say our marriage vows

01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,282
before she died in my arms.

01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,730
There can be no doubt now.

01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,399
Queen Elsa is a monster,

01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,523
and we are all in grave danger.

01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,921
Prince Hans,

01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:56,483
Arendelle looks to you.

01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,719
With a heavy heart,

01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:03,891
I charge Queen Elsa of Arendelle with treason.

01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:06,968
And sentence her to death.

01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,481
Hurry up!

01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:21,639
She's dangerous.

01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:23,001
Move quickly. Careful!

01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,250
It won't open! It's frozen shut.

01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:27,686
Put your back into it!

01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:29,279
Come on! Push!

01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:56,559
What is it, buddy?

01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,205
Hey, watch it.

01:18:58,560 --> 01:18:59,761
What's wrong with you?

01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,282
I don't understand you when you talk like that.

01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:08,079
Stop it! Put me down!

01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,639
No, Sven!

01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:13,239
We're not going back.

01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:14,930
She's with her true love.

01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:22,921
What the...

01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:26,841
Anna!

01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,685
Come on! Come on, boy.

01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:53,881
Help.

01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,525
Anna!

01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:02,680
Oh, no.

01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,081
Olaf?

01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:18,482
Olaf. Get away from there.

01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,161
Wow!

01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,919
So, this is heat.

01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:24,439
I love it.

01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:26,210
Ooh! But don't touch it.

01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:37,444
So, where's Hans? What happened to your kiss?

01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:41,806
I was wrong about him. It wasn't true love.

01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,725
But we ran all the way here.

01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,239
Please, Olaf, you can't stay here. You'll melt.

01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:48,359
I am not leaving here until

01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:51,131
we find some other act of true love to save you.

01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,369
Do you happen to have any ideas?

01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:55,410
I don't even know what love is.

01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,484
That's okay, I do.

01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,285
Love is

01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:02,647
putting someone else's needs before yours.

01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:07,211
Like, you know, how Kristoff brought you back here to Hans and left you forever.

01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:12,529
Kristoff loves me?

01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:17,607
Wow, you really don't know anything about love, do you?

01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:19,924
Olaf, you're melting.

01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,402
Some people are worth melting for.

01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,642
Just maybe not right this second.

01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,286
Don't worry, I've got it.

01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,923
We're gonna get through... Oh, wait.

01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,690
Hang on, I'm getting something.

01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:43,159
It's Kristoff and Sven!

01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:44,566
They're coming back this way.

01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,361
They... They are?

01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:49,160
Wow! He's really moving fast.

01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,639
I guess I was wrong.

01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:53,207
I guess Kristoff doesn't love you enough to leave you behind.

01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,839
Help me up, Olaf. Please.

01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:58,999
No, no, no! You need to stay by the fire and keep warm.

01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,759
I need to get to Kristoff.

01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:02,041
Why?

01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:04,959
Oh, I know why!

01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,159
There's your act of true love right there!

01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:11,159
Riding across the fjords like a valiant, pungent reindeer king!

01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:12,646
Come on!

01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:16,519
Look out!

01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:17,960
Oh!

01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,370
Uh... Back this way.

01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:29,250
We're trapped.

01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:42,880
Oh...

01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,410
Whoa!

01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,130
Slide, Anna!

01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:03,571
We made it!

01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,330
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,570
Come on, buddy, faster.

01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,411
Kristoff!

01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,645
Keep going!

01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,485
Kristoff!

01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:48,167
Come on!

01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:03,567
No.

01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:19,841
Whoa!

01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,050
Whoa!

01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,010
Sven!

01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:43,965
Good boy.

01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:56,771
Kristoff.

01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:59,609
Kristoff...

01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:01,601
Anna!

01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:08,369
Elsa! You can't run from this!

01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,639
Just take care of my sister.

01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,279
Your sister?

01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,926
She returned from the mountain weak and cold.

01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,239
She said that you froze her heart.

01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:20,399
No.

01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,648
I tried to save her, but it was too late.

01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,441
Her skin was ice. Her hair turned white.

01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:29,570
Your sister is dead.

01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:31,999
Because of you.

01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,247
No.

01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:56,521
Kristoff.

01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:59,450
Anna!

01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,405
Elsa?

01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:22,807
No!

01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,401
Anna!

01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,850
Oh. Anna!

01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:41,802
No, no!

01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:43,445
Please, no.

01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,201
Anna?

01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:35,210
Anna?

01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:39,880
Oh, Elsa.

01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,407
You sacrificed yourself for me?

01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:45,519
I love you.

01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:50,442
"An act of true love will thaw a frozen heart."

01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,690
"Love will thaw."

01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,439
Love. Of course.

01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,721
Elsa?

01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:00,441
Love!

01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:48,691
I knew you could do it.

01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:52,442
Hands down, this is the best day of my life.

01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,759
And, quite possibly, the last.

01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:57,281
Oh, Olaf! Hang on, little guy.

01:28:57,560 --> 01:28:59,250
Oh, Oh, Oh!

01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:04,443
My own personal flurry!

01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:10,770
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:14,841
Anna?

01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,844
But she froze your heart.

01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:19,771
The only frozen heart around here is yours.

01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:26,724
Wonderful!

01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:41,205
Setting course, sir.

01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:46,839
I will return this scoundrel to his country.

01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:50,761
We shall see what his twelve big brothers think of his behavior.

01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,479
Arendelle thanks you, milord.

01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,319
This is unacceptable.

01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:57,479
I am a victim of fear. I've been traumatized.

01:29:57,480 --> 01:29:59,364
Ah! My neck hurts.

01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:03,039
Is there a doctor that I could see?

01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:05,439
And I demand to see the queen!

01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,642
Oh. I have a message from the queen.

01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,919
"Arendelle will henceforth and forever

01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:14,045
"no longer do business of any sort with Weaseltown."

01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,239
"Weselton."

01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:16,799
It's Weselton!

01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:17,919
Come on, come on, come on!

01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,399
Okay, okay, here I come.

01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,489
Pole! - Whoops! Sorry.

01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:24,211
Okay, Okay.

01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:26,044
Here we are. Oh!

01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:30,363
I owe you a sled.

01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:35,204
Are you serious? - Yes!

01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:36,999
And it's the latest model.

01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,599
No, I can't accept this.

01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:41,565
You have to. No returns. No exchanges. Queen's orders.

01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:45,521
She's named you the Official Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer.

01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,519
What? That's not a thing. - Oh, sure it is.

01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:51,039
And it even has a cup holder. Do you like it?

01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:53,359
Like it? I love it!

01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,439
Whoa.

01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:56,290
I could kiss you!

01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,879
I could. I mean, I'd like to. I'd...

01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:01,079
May I? We me. I mean, may we?

01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:02,327
Wait, what?

01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:04,566
We may.

01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:09,926
Summer!

01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,799
Ooh...

01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,879
Hello.

01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:33,239
Are you ready?

01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:41,282
Ice!

01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:55,125
Swing me.

01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,804
Ooh...

01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,759
I like the open gates.

01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:02,122
We are never closing them again.

01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:07,127
Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful, but you know I don't skate.

01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:08,731
Come on! You can do it!

01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,359
Look out. Reindeer coming through.

01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,119
I got it, I got it. I don't got it, I don't got it.

01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:14,199
Hey, guys!

01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:15,519
That's it, Olaf.

01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:18,839
Glide and pivot. And glide and pivot.
