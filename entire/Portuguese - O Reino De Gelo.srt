00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,727
I sell ice for a living.
Vendo gelo para viver.
[Seeing ice to live.]

00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,999
Ooh. That's a rough business to be in right now.
Nos tempos que correm, parece-me ser um negócio complicado.
[These days, it seems to me to be a tricky business.]

00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,359
I mean, that is really...
Quero dizer, é o que...
[I mean, that's what...]

00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,721
That's unfortunate.
Que infelicidade.
[That unhappiness.]

00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,999
Still forty.
É quarenta à mesma.
[It is forty to it.]

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,248
But I will throw in a visit to Oaken's sauna.
Mas posso convidá-lo a visitar a Sauna do Oaken!
[But I invite you to visit the Sauna Oaken!]

Ten's all I got. Help me out.
Só tenho dez.
[Just I got in December]

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,801
Okay. Ten will get you this and no more.
Com dez só dá para isto, nada mais.
[With ten only gives for it, nothing more.]

00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,079
Okay, just tell me one thing.
Diga-me uma coisa,
[Tell me something,]

00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,039
What was happening on the North Mountain?

00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,959
Did it seem magical?

Agora, afasta-te, enquanto lido com este charlatão.
[Now, get away while I deal with this charlatan.]

00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,651
What did you call me?
O que me chamou?
[What struck me?]

00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,410
Okay, okay. I'm out.
Certo, certo. Já estou cá fora.
[Right, right. I'm already outside.]

00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,799
Whoa!

00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,286
Bye-bye.
Adeusinho.
[Bye.]

00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,441
No, Sven, I didn't get your carrots.
Não, Sven, não trouxe as tuas cenouras.
[No, Sven, did not bring your carrots.]

00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,364
But I did find us a place to sleep.
Mas encontrei um lugar para dormirmos.
[But I found a place to we sleep.]

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,570
And it's free.
E é gratuito.
[And it's free.]

I'm sorry about this violence.

00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,091
so we have good feelings.
para que atrai energias positivas.
[for attracting positive energies.]

00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,930
Just the outfit and the boots, yah?
Será então só as botas e o fato, ya?
[It will then only boots and the fact ya?]

00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,361
Uh...

00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,884
Reindeers are better than people
As renas são melhores que as pessoas
[The reindeer are better than people]

00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,843
Sven, don't you think that's true?
Sven, não concordas comigo?
[Sven did not agree with me?]

00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,239
"Yeah, people will beat you and curse you and cheat you"
"Porque as pessoas, vão-te bater, enganar, amaldiçoar"
["Because people, will you beat, cheat, curse"]

00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,841
"Every one of them's bad, except you!"
"São todos mau, excepto tu."
[" They're all bad, except you."]

00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,804
Aw. Thanks, buddy.
Obrigado, rapaz.
[Thank you, young man.]

00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,449
But people smell better than reindeers
Mas as pessoas cheiram melhor que as renas
[But people smell better than the reindeer]

00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,765
Sven, don't you think I'm right?
Sven, não achas que estou certo?
[Sven, do not you think I'm right?]

00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,167
"That's once again true, for all except you!"
"Estás novamente certo, todos, excepto tu"
["You are right again, everyone, except you"]

00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,479
You got me! Let's call it a night.
Apanhaste-me! Vamos encerrar a noite.
[You got me! Let's call it a night.]

00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,409
"Good night"

Morda.
[Bite.]

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,845
Nice duet.
Foi um bom dueto.
[It was a good duet.]

00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,926
It's just you. What do you want?
Que queres?

I want you to take me up the North Mountain.
Quero que me leves à Montanha do Norte.

I don't take people places.
Não levo pessoas a lugares.
[I do not take people to places.]

00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,759
Let me rephrase that.
Deixa-me reformular.
[Let me rephrase.]

00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,405

[and forgot Carrots Sven.]

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,999
Oops, sorry.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't...
Desculpa, desculpa. Não queria...

Hang on! We like to go fast.
Agarra-te bem. Gostamos de velocidade.

00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,919
I like fast. - Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Eu gosto da velocidade.
[I like the speed.]

00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,639
Get your feet down. This is fresh lacquer.
Pés para baixos. Acabei de o envernizar.
[Feet low. Just the varnish.]

00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,239
Seriously, were you raised in a barn?
Sinceramente, cresceste numa quinta?
[Honestly, grew up on a farm?]

00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,679
Ugh!

00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,486
No, I was raised in a castle.
Não, cresci num castelo.
[No, I grew up in a castle.]

00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,405
So, uh, tell me,
Conta-me, porque razão
[Tell me, why]

00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,643
what made the queen go all ice-crazy?
a Rainha congelou tudo?
[Queen froze all?]

00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,881
Oh. Well...

00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,640
It was all my fault.
A culpa foi minha.
[It was my fault.]

00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,119
I got engaged, but then she freaked out,
Fiquei noiva, mas o problema foi
[I got engaged, but the problem was]

00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,971
because I'd only just met him you know, that day.
porque o tinha acabado... de o conhecer.
[because had just... to know him.]

00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,879
And she said she wouldn't bless the marriage, and...
E ela não me quis dar a sua bênção...
[And she would not give me his blessing...]

00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,439
Wait. You got engaged to someone you just met that day?
Espera. Ficaste noiva de um tipo que acabaste de conhecer?
[Wait. You were engaged to a guy who just met?]

00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,759
Yeah. Anyway, I got mad, and so she got mad,
Sim. Adiante, enervei-me, ela enervou-se,
[Yes. Go ahead, I enervei me, it unnerved,]

00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,879
and then she tried to walk away, and I grabbed her glove...
depois ela tentou sair, então eu puxei-lhe a luva.
[after she tried to leave, so I pulled her glove.]

00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,039
Hang on!
Espera lá.
[Wait.]

00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,999
You mean to tell me you got engaged
Acabaste de me dizer que ficaste noiva
[Just tell me that you stayed bride]

00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,679
to someone you just met that day?
de um tipo que tinhas conhecido há horas?!
[of a kind you had known for hours?!]

00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,120
Yes. Pay attention.
Sim, mas presta atenção.
[Yes, but watch.]

00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,199
But the thing is, she wore the gloves all the time,
O problema foi, ela usava sempre luvas,
[The problem was, she always wore gloves,]

00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,639
so I just thought, maybe she has a thing about dirt.
e eu pensei: "Talvez não goste de pó."
[and I thought, "Maybe not like dust."]

00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,684
Didn't your parents ever warn you about strangers?
Os teus pais nunca te avisaram para não falares com estranhos?
[Your parents never warned you not to talk to strangers?]

00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,169
Yyyyyes, they did.
Sim, disseram.
[Yes, they said.]

00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,961
But Hans is not a stranger.
Mas o Hans não é um estranho.
[But Hans is not a stranger.]

00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,959
Oh, yeah? What's his last name?
Ai não? Qual é o seu último nome?
[Is not? What's your last name?]

00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,559

Have you had a meal with him yet? What if you hate the way he eats?
Já comeram alguma refeição juntos? E se não gostares da forma de comer dele?
[Have you eaten a meal together? And if you do not like the way we eat it?]

00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,531
What if you hate the way he picks his nose?

All men do it.

00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,559
Look, it doesn't matter. It's true love.
Nada mais importa, se for amor verdadeiro.
[Nothing else matters if it is true love.]

00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,220
It doesn't sound like true love.
Não me parece que seja o caso.
[I do not think is the case.]

00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,526
Are you some sort of love expert?
E tu és algum experiente no assunto?
[And you're experienced in any subject?]

No. But, uh, I have friends who are.

who are love experts? I'm not buying it.

[who realize the true love? I can not believe.]

Stop talking. - No, no, no. No, no.
Pára de falar. - Não, não, não.

00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,279

Duck!
Abaixa-te!
[Bow down!]

00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,759
You almost set me on fire!
Quase que me incendiados!
[Almost burned me!]

00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,961
But I didn't.
Mas não o fiz.
[But I did not.]

00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,759
Get ready to jump, Sven!
Prepara-te para saltar, Sven!
[Get ready to jump, Sven!]

00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,279
You don't tell him what to do.
Não lhe digas o que fazer.
[Do not tell him what to do.]

00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,845
I do!
Eu é que digo.
[I is what I say.]

00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,879
Jump, Sven!
Salto, Sven!
[Heels, Sven!]

00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,121
Phew!

00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,886
But I just paid it off.
Tinha acabado de o pagar.
[I had just the pay.]

00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,044
Uh-oh. No. No.

00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,519
No!

00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,399
Ah! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Não, não, não!
[No no no!]

00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,681
Grab on!
Agarra!
[Grabs!]

00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,199
Pull, Sven. Pull!
Puxe, Sven! Puxe!
[Pull, Sven! Pull!]

00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,239
Whoa.

00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,688
I'll replace your sled, and everything in it.
Eu ofereço-te um trenó novo, igual ao que tinhas.
[I offer you a new sled, like the one you had.]

00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,281
And I understand if you don't want to help me anymore.
Caso não me queiras ajudar mais, vou compreender perfeitamente.
[If you do not wanna help me more, I understand perfectly.]

00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,446
Of course I don't want to help her anymore. In fact,
Claro que não a quero ajudar mais. Aliás,
[Of course not want to help more. incidentally,]

00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,039
this whole thing has ruined me for helping anyone ever again.
depois do que se passou, dificilmente volto a ajudar alguém.
[after what happened, hardly back to help someone.]

00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,079
It's this way?

00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,199
"She'll die on her own."
"Se não a ajudares, ela morre."
["If not you help, she dies."]

00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,084
I can live with that. - Here we go.
Posso viver com isso.
[I can live with that.]

00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,319
"But you won't get your new sled if she's dead."
"Mas se ela morrer não receberás um novo trenó."
["But if she dies you will not receive a new sled."]

00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,931
I think, actually, it's up.

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,399
Sometimes, I really don't like you.
Por vezes odeio-te.
[Sometimes I hate you.]

00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,921
Hold up! We're coming.
Espera! Estamos a ir.
[Wait! We are going.]

00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,399
You are?
A sério?
[Seriously?]

00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,559
I mean, sure. I'll let you tag along.
Quero dizer, claro. Deixo-te que venhas comigo.
[I mean, sure. I leave you to come with me.]

00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,205
Arendelle.

00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,928
It's completely frozen.
Está completamente congelada.
[It is completely frozen.]

00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,079
But it will be fine. Elsa will thaw it.
Mas vai ficar tudo bem. A Elsa vai corrigir tudo.
[But it will be all right. Elsa will fix everything.]

00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,439
Will she?
Vai?
[Go?]

00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,119
Yeah. Now, come on.
Sim. Agora, anda.
[Yes. Now, come on.]

00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,959
This way to the North Mountain?
É este o caminho para a Montanha do Norte?
[Is this the way to North Mountain?]

00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,599
More like this way.
É mais por ali.
[It's there.]

00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,162
I never knew winter could be so beautiful.
Nunca pensei que o Inverno fosse tão lindo.
[I never thought that winter was so beautiful.]

00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,559
Yeah.

00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,683
It really is beautiful, isn't it?

00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,361
But it's so white.

00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,610
You know, how about a little color?

00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,999
I'm thinking maybe some crimson, chartreuse.

00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,645
How about yellow?

00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,963
No, not yellow. Yellow and snow?

00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,479
No go.

00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,930
Am I right?

00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,239
You're creepy.

00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,639
I don't want it.

00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,079
Back at you. - Please don't drop me.

00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,359
Come on, it's just a head.

00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,679
All right. We got off to a bad start.

00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,086
Ew, ew, ew, the body!

00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,799
Wait, what am I looking at right now?

00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,519
Why are you hanging off the earth like a bat?

00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,999
All right, wait one second.

00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,531
Oh. Uh...

00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,759
Oh!

00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,325
Thank you. - You're welcome.

00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,399
Now, I'm perfect.

00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,086
Well, almost.

00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,159
It was like my whole life got turned upside down.

00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,441
Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry!

00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,359
Head rush! - I was just... Are you okay?

00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,879
Are you kidding me? I am wonderful!

00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,730
I've always wanted a nose.

00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,119
So cute.

00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,879
It's like a little baby unicorn.

00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,999
But... Hey! Whoa!

00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,039
Oh.

00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,049
I love it even more.

00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,085
All right, let's start this thing over.

00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,239
Hi, everyone.

00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,319
I'm Olaf.

00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,726
And I like warm hugs.

00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,281
Olaf?

00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,409
That's right. Olaf.

00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,608
And you are?

00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,081
Oh. Um...

00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,239
I'm Anna.

00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,679
And who's the funky-looking donkey over there?

00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,239
That's Sven.

00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,199
And who's the reindeer?

00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,239
Sven.

00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,079
Oh, they're... Oh. Okay. That makes things easier for me.

00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,760
Aw, look at him trying to kiss my nose.

00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,883
I like you, too.

00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,522
Olaf. Did Elsa build you? - Yeah. Why?

00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,759
Do you know where she is? - Yeah. Why?

00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,919
Fascinating.

00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,681
Do you think you could show us the way? - Yeah. Why?

00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,119
How does this work? Ow!

00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,359
Stop it, Sven. Trying to focus, here.

00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,562
Yeah. Why? - I'll tell you why.

00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,645
We need Elsa to bring back summer.

00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,519
Summer?

00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,839
Oh. I don't know why,

00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,599
but I've always loved the idea of summer

00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,199
and sun, and all things hot.

00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,279
Really?

00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,839
I'm guessing you don't have much experience with heat.

00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,121
Nope.

00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,759
But sometimes I like to close my eyes,

00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,806
and imagine what it would be like when summer does come.

00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:50,119
Bees will buzz, kids will blow dandelion fuzz

00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:55,087
And I'll be doing whatever snow does in summer

00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,839
A drink in my hand

00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,239
My snow up against the burning sand

00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,519
Probably getting gorgeously tanned

00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,290
In summer.

00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,879
I'll finally see a summer breeze

00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,999
Blow away a winter storm

00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,279
And find out what happens to solid water

00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,211
When it gets warm

00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,999
And I can't wait to see

00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,043
What my buddies all think of me

00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,799
Just imagine how much cooler I'll be

00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,207
In summer!

00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,679
The hot and the cold are both so intense

00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,247
Put them together It just makes sense

00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,679
Winter's a good time to stay in and cuddle

00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,223
But put me in summer and I'll be a...

00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,520
<i>(puddle?)</i>

00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,599
Happy snowman!

00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,879
When life gets rough

00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,401
I like to hold on to my dream

00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:55,407
Of relaxing in the summer sun, just letting off steam

00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,285
Oh, the sky will be blue

00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,724
And you guys will be there, too

00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,679
When I finally do

00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:09,168
What frozen things do in summer!

00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:10,884
I'm gonna tell him.

00:49:10,885 --> 00:49:11,884
Don't you dare.

00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,687
In summer!

00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,559
So, come on! Elsa's this way.

00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,759
Let's go bring back summer!

00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,200
I'm coming!

00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,525
Somebody's gotta tell him.

00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,039
No, no. You've got the bark facing down.

00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,765
The bark needs to be face-up.

00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,239
Bark down is drier. - Bark up!

00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,279
Bark down! - Papa!

00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,999
Cloak? Does anyone need a cloak?

00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,199
Arendelle is indebted to you, Your Highness.

00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,559
The castle is open.

00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,730
There is soup and hot gløgg in the Great Hall.

00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,919
Here, pass these out.

00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,479
Prince Hans!

00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,999
Are we expected to just sit here and freeze

00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,646
while you give away all of Arendelle's tradable goods?

00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,399
Princess Anna has given her orders.

00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,199
And that's another thing!

00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,799
Has it dawned on you that your princess may be conspiring

00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,119
with a wicked sorceress

00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,199
to destroy us all?

00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,970
Do not question the princess.

00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,479
She left me in charge

00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,799
and I will not hesitate

00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,525
to protect Arendelle from treason.

00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,279
Treason?

00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:23,719
Whoa! Whoa!

00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,519
Whoa, boy. Easy.

00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,801
Easy.

00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,120
It's Princess Anna's horse.

00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,925
So, where is the princess?

00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,120
Where could she be? - Where is she?

00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,805
Princess Anna is in trouble.

00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,159
I need volunteers to go with me to find her.

00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,399
I'll go. I volunteer.

00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,568
I volunteer two men, My Lord.

00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,491
Be prepared for anything.

00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,842
And should you encounter the queen,

00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,966
you are to put an end to this winter.

00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,091
Do you understand?

00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,205
So, how exactly are you planning to stop this weather?

00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,081
Oh. I am gonna talk to my sister.

00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,479
That's your plan?

00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,359
My ice business is riding on you talking to your sister?

00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,766
Yep.

00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,885
So, you're not at all afraid of her?

00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,090
Why would I be?

00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:14,643
Yeah. I bet she's the nicest, gentlest, warmest person ever.

00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,799
Oh. Look at that.

00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,207
I've been impaled.

00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,527
What now?

00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,009
Mmm...

00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,799
It's too steep.

00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,319
I've only got one rope and you don't know how to climb mountains.

00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,679
Says who?

00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,120
Hmm?

00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,561
What are you doing?

00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:39,646
I'm going to see my sister.

00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,241
You're gonna kill yourself.

00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,839
I wouldn't put my foot there.

00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,690
You're distracting me. - Or there.

00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,639
How do you know Elsa even wants to see you?

00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,399
All right. I'm just blocking you out

00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,251
because I gotta concentrate, here.

00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,919
You know, most people who disappear

00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,451
into the mountains want to be alone.

00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,882
Nobody wants to be alone.

00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,399
Except maybe you.

00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,649
I'm not alone. I have friends, remember?

00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,364
You mean, the love experts?

00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,563
Yes, the love experts.

00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,764
Ah...

00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,090
Please tell me I'm almost there.

00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,519
Does the air seem a bit thin to you up here?

00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,119
Hang on.

00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,321
Hey, Sven?

00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,239
Not sure if this is gonna solve the problem,

00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,279
but I found a staircase that leads exactly

00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,479
where you wanted to go.

00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,599
Ha-ha! Thank goodness. Catch!

00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,886
Thanks. That was like a crazy trust exercise.

00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,759
Whoa.

00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,803
Now, that's ice.

00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,799
I might cry.

00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,571
Go ahead. I won't judge.

00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,759
All right, take it easy, boy. Come here.

00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,485
I got you.

00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,327
Okay. You stay right here, buddy.

00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,606
Flawless.

00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,881
Knock.

00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,211
Just knock.

00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,770
Why isn't she knocking?

00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,165
Do you think she knows how to knock?

00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,959
Huh. It opened.

00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,446
That's a first.

00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,519
Oh. You should probably wait out here.

00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,639
What? - The last time I introduced her to a guy,

00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,999
she froze everything.

00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,919
But, but... Oh, come on!

00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,885
It's a palace made of ice. Ice is my life!

00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:43,999
Bye, Sven.

00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,770
You, too, Olaf.

00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,929
Me? - Just give us a minute.

00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,526
Okay.

00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,290
One, two, three...

00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,724
Four...

00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,281
Whoa.

00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,561
Elsa?

00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,443
It's me, Anna.

00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,965
Anna.

00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:23,162
Whoa. Elsa, you look different.

00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,290
It's a good different.

00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,926
And this place...

00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,566
It's amazing.

00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:29,881
Thank you.

00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,282
I never knew what I was capable of.

00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,479
I'm so sorry about what happened. If I'd have known...

00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,806
No, no, no. It's okay.

00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:41,090
You don't have to apologize, but you should probably go.

00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,879
Please.

00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,241
But I just got here.

00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,564
You belong down in Arendelle.

00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,879
So do you.

00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,208
No, Anna, I belong here.

00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,401
Alone.

00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:56,850
Where I can be who I am without hurting anybody.

00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,083
Actually, about that...

00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,370
Sixty! - Wait. What is that?

00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,526
Hi! I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs!

00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,367
Olaf?

00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,281
You built me.

00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,041
Remember that?

00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,647
And you're alive?

00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,602
Um... I think so.

00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,686
He's just like the one we built as kids.

00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,046
Yeah.

00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,449
Elsa, we were so close.

00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,524
We can be like that again.

00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,480
Catch me! Slow down!

00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,161
Anna!

00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:36,759
No.

00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,440
We can't. Goodbye, Anna.

00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,559
Elsa, wait.

00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,759
No, I'm just trying to protect you.

00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,611
You don't have to protect me. I'm not afraid.

00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,283
Please don't shut me out again.

00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,519
Please don't slam the door

00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:54,599
You don't have to keep your distance anymore

00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,610
'Cause for the first time in forever

00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,799
I finally understand

00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,159
For the first time in forever

00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,439
We can fix this hand in hand

00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,608
We can head down this mountain together.

00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:09,639
You don't have to live in fear

00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:13,561
'Cause for the first time in forever

00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:16,919
I will be right here

00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,199
<i>Anna.</i>

00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,119
<i>Please go back home</i>

00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,890
<i>Your life awaits</i>

00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,239
<i>Go enjoy the sun, and open up the gates</i>

00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,350
Yeah, but...

00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:27,719
<i>I know.</i>

00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:32,050
<i>You mean well, but leave me be</i>

00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,559
<i>Yes, I'm alone</i>

00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,519
<i>But I'm alone and free</i>

00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:41,282
<i>Just stay away and you'll be safe from me</i>

00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,521
Actually, we're not

00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:44,950
<i>What do you mean, you're not?</i>

00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,450
I get the feeling you don't know

00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,681
<i>What do I not know?</i>

00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,399
Arendelle's in deep, deep, deep

00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,682
deep snow

00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,041
<i>What?</i>

00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:59,002
You kind of set off an eternal winter everywhere.

00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,359
<i>Everywhere?</i>

00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,279
Well, it's okay, you can just unfreeze it.

00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,528
<i>No, I can't. I don't know how.</i>

00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,081
Sure you can. I know you can.

00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:12,401
'Cause for the first time in forever

00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:15,519
<i>Oh, I'm such a fool! I can't be free!</i>

00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:17,950
You don't have to be afraid

00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,839
<i>No escape from the storm inside of me</i>

00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:21,839
We can work this out together

00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,819
<i>I can't control the curse!</i>

00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,639
We'll reverse the storm you've made

00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:29,219
<i>Anna, please you'll only make it worse!</i>

00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,019
Don't panic!

00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:31,319
<i>There's so much fear!</i>

00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:33,919
We'll make the sun shine bright

00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:35,319
<i>You're not safe here!</i>

00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:37,119
We can face this thing together

00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:38,119
<i>No!</i>

00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,279
We can change this winter weather

00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,768
And everything will be all right

00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,761
<i>I can't!</i>

00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,441
Anna!

00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,201
Are you okay?

00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,479
I'm okay.

00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,920
I'm fine.

00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,159
Who's this?

00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,771
Wait, it doesn't matter. Just...

00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,199
You have to go.

00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,999
No, I know we can figure this out together.

00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,079
How?

00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,442
What power do you have to stop this winter?

00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,046
To stop me?

00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,559
Anna, I think we should go.

00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,559
No, I'm not leaving without you, Elsa.

00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,444
Yes, you are.

00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,799
Stop! Put us down!

00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,604
Go away.

00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,565
Heads up!

00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,439
Watch out for my butt!

00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,959
It is not nice to throw people!

00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,199
Whoa, whoa, whoa, feisty-pants. Okay, relax.

00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,599
Just calm down! Calm down! - Okay! All right!

00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,279
I'm okay. - Just let the snowman be.

00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,599
I'm calm.

00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,325
Oh! Come on!

00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,839
Oh. Look, see? Now you made him mad.

00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,804
I'll distract him. You guys go.

00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,331
No, no! Not you guys!

00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,480
This just got a whole lot harder.

00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,321
Look out!

00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,763
What are you doing?

00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,441
I got him!

00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,159
Whoa! Stop!

00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,407
It's a hundred-foot drop.

00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,007
It's two hundred.

00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,521
Ow!

00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,199
What's that for? - I'm digging a snow anchor.

00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,890
Okay. What if we fall?

00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,119
There's 20 feet of fresh powder down there.

00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,879
It'll be like landing on a pillow.

00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:42,959
Hopefully.

00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,199
Okay, Anna. On three.

00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,559
One...

00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:50,639
Okay. You tell me when. I'm ready to go.

00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,279
Two... - I was born ready! Yes!

00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,561
Calm down.

00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,679
Tree!

00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,961
What the... Whoa!

00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,604
That happened.

01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,519
Man, am I out of shape.

01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,519
There we go. Hey, Anna!

01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,359
Sven! Where did you guys go?

01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,211
We totally lost Marshmallow back there.

01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,039
Hey! We were just talking about you.

01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,208
All good things, all good things.

01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:23,721
No!

01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,199
This is not making much of a difference, is it?

01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,799
Olaf!

01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,764
Hang in there, guys!

01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:35,959
Go. Go faster!

01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,810
Wait, what?

01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,599
Ow!

01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,079
Kristoff!

01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,808
Don't come back!

01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,521
We won't.

01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,484
Hey, you were right. Just like a pillow.

01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:04,886
Olaf!

01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,999
I can't feel my legs! I can't feel my legs!

01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,559
Those are my legs.

01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,079
Oooh. Hey, do me a favor, grab my butt.

01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,169
Oh. That feels better.

01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,921
Hey, Sven! He found us.

01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,159
Who's my cute little reindeer?

01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,279
Don't talk to him like that.

01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,164
You're tickling me.

01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,281
Here.

01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:27,599
Whoa!

01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,799
Are you okay?

01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,365
Thank you.

01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,526
How's your head? - Ah! Ooh!

01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,439
It's fine. Uh...

01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,119
Uh, I'm good. I've got a thick skull.

01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:39,129
I don't have a skull.

01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:40,921
Or bones.

01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,641
So, uh... So, now what?

01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,799
Now what?

01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,199
Now what?

01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,481
Oh...

01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,040
What am I gonna do?

01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,839
She threw me out.

01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,199
I can't go back to Arendelle with the weather like this.

01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,279
And then there's your ice business.

01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,006
Hey, hey. Don't worry about my ice business.

01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,259
Worry about your hair!

01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:02,639
What? I just fell off a cliff. You should see your hair.

01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,359
No, yours is turning white.

01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:07,279
White? It's... What?

01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,482
It's because she struck you, isn't it?

01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,690
Does it look bad?

01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,039
No. - You hesitated.

01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,287
No, I didn't.

01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,559
Anna, you need help, okay? Come on.

01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,250
Okay! Where are we going?

01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,359
To see my friends.

01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,679
The love experts?

01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,530
Love experts?

01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,159
And don't worry, they'll be able to fix this.

01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,010
How do you know?

01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,723
Because I've seen them do it before.

01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,159
I like to consider myself a love expert.

01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,570
Get it together.

01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,559
Control it.

01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,364
Don't feel. Don't feel.

01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,490
Don't feel.

01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:48,324
Don't feel!

01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,407
Look, Sven, the sky's awake.

01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,569
Are you cold? - A little.

01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,959
Uh... Wait. Come here.

01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,241
Huh?

01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,251
Ooh.

01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,919
So, uh, about my friends. Well...

01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,359
I say "friends"...

01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,399
They're more like family.

01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,399
Anyway, when I was a kid, it was just me and Sven.

01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,489
Until they, you know, kinda took us in.

01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,365
They did?

01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:34,679
Yeah. I don't want to scare you.

01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:39,119
They can be a little inappropriate and loud.

01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,685
Very loud.

01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,679
They are also stubborn at times,

01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:43,959
and a little overbearing.

01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,759
And heavy. Really, really, heavy.

01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,119
But you'll get it. They mean well.

01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,448
Kristoff, they sound wonderful.

01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:54,971
Okay, then.

01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,489
Meet my family.

01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,401
Hey, guys.

01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,450
They're rocks.

01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,799
You are a sight for sore eyes.

01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,731
He's crazy. - Hey look, ???'s back from vacation!

01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,488
Rocko's looking sharp, as usual.

01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,919
Clay, whoa... I don't even recognize you.

01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,039
You lost so much weight.

01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,999
I'll distract him while you run.

01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,123
Hi, Sven's family!

01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,801
It's nice to meet you.

01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,439
Because I love you, Anna, I insist you run.

01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:27,531
I understand you're love experts. Ooh!

01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,490
Why aren't you running?

01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:30,799
Uh...

01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,287
Okay. Well, I'm gonna go.

01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,444
No, no, no. Anna, wait.

01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,490
Kristoff!

01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,444
Whoa!

01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,166
Hey!

01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,559
Kristoff's home!

01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:49,839
Kristoff's here! Kristoff's home!

01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,319
Wait, "Kristoff"?

01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,799
Ah, let me look at you.

01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,479
Take off your clothes, I wash them.

01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,364
No! No, I'm going to keep my clothes on.

01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:58,799
Look, it's great to see you all,

01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,039
but where's Granpabbie?

01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:01,159
He's napping.

01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,959
But look, I grew a mushroom.

01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,559
I earned my fire crystal.

01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,000
I passed a kidney stone.

01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,319
Kristoff, pick me up.

01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,599
You're getting big.

01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,881
Good for you.

01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,568
Trolls. They're trolls!

01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,124
He's brought a girl!

01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,886
A girl!

01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,759
Is that a real girl?

01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,879
She's like a little cupcake.

01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:23,959
What's going on?

01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,286
I've learned to just roll with it.

01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,879
Let me see. Bright eyes, working nose,

01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,411
strong teeth!

01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:32,279
Yes, yes. She'll do nicely for our Kristoff.

01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:33,519
Wait, wait, wait. Oh, um, no.

01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,919
You've got the wrong idea.

01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:36,079
No. That's not why I brought her here.

01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,959
Right. We're not... I'm not...

01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,159
What's the issue, dear?

01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:43,319
Why are you holding back from such a man?

01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,329
Is it the clumpy way he walks?

01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:47,679
What? - Or the grumpy way he talks?

01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,479
Or the pear-shaped, square-shaped

01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,039
Weirdness of his feet?

01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:52,159
Hey!

01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,119
And though we know he washes well

01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,759
He always ends up sort of smelly

01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,399
But you'll never meet a fella

01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,359
Who's as sensitive and sweet

01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,479
That's nice, but...

01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:03,519
So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper

01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,599
So, he's got a few flaws

01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:06,839
Like his peculiar brain, dear

01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:07,999
His thing with the reindeer

01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,679
That's a little outside of nature's laws

01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:10,799
This is not about me!

01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,559
So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper

01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,759
But this we're certain of

01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:17,399
You can fix this fixer-upper up

01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,199
With a little bit of love

01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,239
Can we please just stop talking about this?

01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,479
We've got a real, actual problem, here.

01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:26,081
I'll say. So, tell me, dear...

01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,359
Is it the way that he runs scared?

01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,449
Or that he's socially impaired?

01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,879
Or that he only likes to tinkle in the woods?

01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:34,999
I did not need to know that.

01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,239
Are you holding back your fondness

01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,719
Due to his unmanly blondness?

01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:43,403
Or the way he covers up that he's the honest goods?

01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,519
He's just a bit of a fixer-upper

01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,039
He's got a couple of bugs

01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:50,919
(No, I don't!) - His isolation is confirmation

01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:53,919
Of his desperation for healing hugs

01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,479
So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper

01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,239
But we know what to do

01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,279
The way to fix up this fixer-upper

01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,839
Is to fix him up with you

01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,519
Whoa!

01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,165
Stop it, stop it, stop it! Enough!

01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:08,366
She is engaged to someone else, okay?

01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,079
So, she's a bit of a fixer-upper

01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,009
That's a minor thing

01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,479
Her quote "engagement" is a flex arrangement

01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,839
And by the way, I don't see no ring

01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:23,119
So, she's a bit of a fixer-upper

01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:25,322
Her brain's a bit betwixt

01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,799
Get the fiance out of the way

01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,121
And the whole thing will be fixed

01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,959
We're not saying you can change him

01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,049
'Cause people don't really change

01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,679
We're only saying that love's a force

01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:41,039
That's powerful and strange

01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:43,279
People make bad choices

01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,687
If they're mad or scared or stressed

01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,799
But throw a little love their way

01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,159
Throw a little love their way

01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,283
And you'll bring out their best

01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,688
True love brings out the best

01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,367
Everyone's a bit of a fixer-upper

01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,319
That's what it's all about

01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,399
Father! Sister! Brother!

01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:04,199
We need each other to raise us up

01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,561
And round us out

01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,959
Everyone's a bit of a fixer-upper

01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:11,479
But when push comes to shove

01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:12,759
The only fixer-upper fixer

01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:13,839
That can fix a fixer-upper is...

01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:17,279
True, true

01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:18,399
True

01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,479
Love!

01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:20,839
Love, love, love

01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:22,839
Love! True love

01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:23,999
True

01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,199
Do you, Anna, take Kristoff to be your trollfully wedded...

01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,159
Wait, what? - You're getting married.

01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,319
Love!

01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,601
Anna?

01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:34,806
She's as cold as ice.

01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:39,170
There is strange magic here.

01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:42,563
Granpabbie. - Come, come. Bring her here to me.

01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:46,725
Anna, your life is in danger.

01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:50,324
There is ice in your heart put there by your sister.

01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:55,648
If not removed, to solid ice will you freeze, forever.

01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,239
What? No.

01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,679
But you can remove it, right?

01:08:58,680 --> 01:08:59,879
I cannot

01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,889
I'm sorry, Kristoff.

01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,399
If it was her head, that would be easy.

01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:09,401
But only an act of true love can thaw a frozen heart.

01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,679
An act of true love?

01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:14,167
A true love's kiss, perhaps?

01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:20,279
(Something's wrong. Are you all right?)

01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,879
Anna, we've got to get you back to Hans.

01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:23,999
Hans.

01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,201
Pull us out, Sven.

01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,359
Olaf, come on!

01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:31,085
I'm coming!

01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,363
Let's go kiss Hans!

01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,484
Who is this Hans?

01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,489
We are here to find Princess Anna.

01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:51,442
Be on guard, but no harm is to come to the queen.

01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:53,879
Do you understand?

01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:55,880
Yes, Your Grace.

01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,491
The queen.

01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,568
Go, go! Come on!

01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:29,887
There!

01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,567
Up there!

01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,325
Come on!

01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,081
We got her.

01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,920
No. Please.

01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,530
Go around. Toss it.

01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,886
Stay away!

01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,326
Look out!

01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,839
Fire! Fire!

01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,246
Get her!

01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,321
Ah!

01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,926
Come on!

01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,007
Grab his arm.

01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,441
Aim...

01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,239
This way, this way!

01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:48,441
Whoa!

01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:51,847
Queen Elsa!

01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,761
Don't be the monster they fear you are.

01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,927
Oh, no. What have... What have I done?

01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,491
Why did you bring me here?

01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,439
I couldn't just let them kill you.

01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,769
But I'm a danger to Arendelle. Get Anna.

01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,199
Anna has not returned.

01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,048
If you would just stop the winter.

01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,846
Bring back summer, please.

01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,645
Don't you see?

01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,280
I can't.

01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:18,281
You have to tell them to let me go.

01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,889
I will do what I can.

01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:46,999
Just hang in there.

01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,361
Come on, buddy, faster!

01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,359
Oh, boy!

01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,562
Whoa! I'll meet you guys at the castle!

01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:58,999
Stay out of sight, Olaf.

01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,725
I will!

01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:04,161
Hello! - It's alive!

01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,725
It's Princess Anna!

01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,969
Are you gonna be okay?

01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,679
Don't worry about me.

01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:30,519
Anna!

01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,439
You had us worried sick. My Lady.

01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:35,439
Get her warm. And find Prince Hans, immediately.

01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,051
We will. Thank you.

01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,731
Make sure she's safe.

01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,679
Oh, you poor girl, you're freezing.

01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:44,089
Oh, let's get you inside now and get you warm.

01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:59,399
I'm going back out to look for Princess Anna.

01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,250
You cannot risk going out there again.

01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:02,599
If anything happens to her...

01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,564
If anything happens to the princess,

01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:07,127
you are all Arendelle has left.

01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:10,519
He's in here.

01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:11,639
Prince Hans.

01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,079
Anna.

01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,199
You're so cold.

01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,439
Hans, you have to kiss me. - What?

01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,159
Now! Now! - Slow down.

01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:19,089
We'll give you two some privacy.

01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,039
What happened out there?

01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,129
Elsa struck me with her powers.

01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,679
You said she'd never hurt you.

01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:25,759
I was wrong.

01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,325
Anna.

01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,690
She froze my heart,

01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:34,366
and only an act of true love can save me.

01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,804
A true love's kiss.

01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:49,160
Oh, Anna.

01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:53,559
If only there was someone out there who loved you.

01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:55,000
What?

01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,284
You said you did.

01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:04,199
As thirteenth in line in my own kingdom,

01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,479
I didn't stand a chance.

01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:09,239
I knew I would have to marry into the throne somewhere.

01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,805
What... What are you talking about?

01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,767
As heir, Elsa was preferable, of course.

01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,839
But no one was getting anywhere with her.

01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:16,919
But you...

01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,439
You were so desperate for love,

01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:21,371
you were willing to marry me just like that.

01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,639
I figured after we married,

01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,799
I would have to stage a little accident for Elsa.

01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,048
Hans! No. Stop.

01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:31,159
But then, she doomed herself,

01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:33,119
and you were dumb enough to go after her.

01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,239
Please.

01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:36,920
All that's left now is to kill Elsa,

01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:38,971
and bring back summer.

01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,439
You're no match for Elsa.

01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,847
No, you're no match for Elsa.

01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:45,681
I, on the other hand,

01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:50,729
am the hero who is going to save Arendelle from destruction.

01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,011
You won't get away with this.

01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,607
Oh...

01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,811
I already have.

01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,324
Please, somebody, help.

01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,123
Please. Please.

01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,999
It's getting colder by the minute.

01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,719
If we don't do something soon, we'll all freeze to death.

01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:20,331
Prince Hans.

01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,443
Princess Anna is...

01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,239
Dead.

01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:25,319
What?

01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:27,010
What happened to her?

01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:33,450
She was killed...

01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,079
... by Queen Elsa.

01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:36,327
No!

01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,681
Her own sister.

01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,967
At least we got to say our marriage vows

01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,282
before she died in my arms.

01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,730
There can be no doubt now.

01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,399
Queen Elsa is a monster,

01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,523
and we are all in grave danger.

01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,921
Prince Hans,

01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:56,483
Arendelle looks to you.

01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,719
With a heavy heart,

01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:03,891
I charge Queen Elsa of Arendelle with treason.

01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:06,968
And sentence her to death.

01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,481
Hurry up!

01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:21,639
She's dangerous.

01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:23,001
Move quickly. Careful!

01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,250
It won't open! It's frozen shut.

01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:27,686
Put your back into it!

01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:29,279
Come on! Push!

01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:56,559
What is it, buddy?

01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,205
Hey, watch it.

01:18:58,560 --> 01:18:59,761
What's wrong with you?

01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,282
I don't understand you when you talk like that.

01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:08,079
Stop it! Put me down!

01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,639
No, Sven!

01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:13,239
We're not going back.

01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:14,930
She's with her true love.

01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:22,921
What the...

01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:26,841
Anna!

01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,685
Come on! Come on, boy.

01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:53,881
Help.

01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,525
Anna!

01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:02,680
Oh, no.

01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,081
Olaf?

01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:18,482
Olaf. Get away from there.

01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,161
Wow!

01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,919
So, this is heat.

01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:24,439
I love it.

01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:26,210
Ooh! But don't touch it.

01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:37,444
So, where's Hans? What happened to your kiss?

01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:41,806
I was wrong about him. It wasn't true love.

01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,725
But we ran all the way here.

01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,239
Please, Olaf, you can't stay here. You'll melt.

01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:48,359
I am not leaving here until

01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:51,131
we find some other act of true love to save you.

01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,369
Do you happen to have any ideas?

01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:55,410
I don't even know what love is.

01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,484
That's okay, I do.

01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,285
Love is

01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:02,647
putting someone else's needs before yours.

01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:07,211
Like, you know, how Kristoff brought you back here to Hans and left you forever.

01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:12,529
Kristoff loves me?

01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:17,607
Wow, you really don't know anything about love, do you?

01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:19,924
Olaf, you're melting.

01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,402
Some people are worth melting for.

01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,642
Just maybe not right this second.

01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,286
Don't worry, I've got it.

01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,923
We're gonna get through... Oh, wait.

01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,690
Hang on, I'm getting something.

01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:43,159
It's Kristoff and Sven!

01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:44,566
They're coming back this way.

01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,361
They... They are?

01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:49,160
Wow! He's really moving fast.

01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,639
I guess I was wrong.

01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:53,207
I guess Kristoff doesn't love you enough to leave you behind.

01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,839
Help me up, Olaf. Please.

01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:58,999
No, no, no! You need to stay by the fire and keep warm.

01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,759
I need to get to Kristoff.

01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:02,041
Why?

01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:04,959
Oh, I know why!

01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,159
There's your act of true love right there!

01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:11,159
Riding across the fjords like a valiant, pungent reindeer king!

01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:12,646
Come on!

01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:16,519
Look out!

01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:17,960
Oh!

01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,370
Uh... Back this way.

01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:29,250
We're trapped.

01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:42,880
Oh...

01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,410
Whoa!

01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,130
Slide, Anna!

01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:03,571
We made it!

01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,330
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,570
Come on, buddy, faster.

01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,411
Kristoff!

01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,645
Keep going!

01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,485
Kristoff!

01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:48,167
Come on!

01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:03,567
No.

01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:19,841
Whoa!

01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,050
Whoa!

01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,010
Sven!

01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:43,965
Good boy.

01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:56,771
Kristoff.

01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:59,609
Kristoff...

01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:01,601
Anna!

01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:08,369
Elsa! You can't run from this!

01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,639
Just take care of my sister.

01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,279
Your sister?

01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,926
She returned from the mountain weak and cold.

01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,239
She said that you froze her heart.

01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:20,399
No.

01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,648
I tried to save her, but it was too late.

01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,441
Her skin was ice. Her hair turned white.

01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:29,570
Your sister is dead.

01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:31,999
Because of you.

01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,247
No.

01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:56,521
Kristoff.

01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:59,450
Anna!

01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,405
Elsa?

01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:22,807
No!

01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,401
Anna!

01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,850
Oh. Anna!

01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:41,802
No, no!

01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:43,445
Please, no.

01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,201
Anna?

01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:35,210
Anna?

01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:39,880
Oh, Elsa.

01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,407
You sacrificed yourself for me?

01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:45,519
I love you.

01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:50,442
"An act of true love will thaw a frozen heart."

01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,690
"Love will thaw."

01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,439
Love. Of course.

01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,721
Elsa?

01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:00,441
Love!

01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:48,691
I knew you could do it.

01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:52,442
Hands down, this is the best day of my life.

01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,759
And, quite possibly, the last.

01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:57,281
Oh, Olaf! Hang on, little guy.

01:28:57,560 --> 01:28:59,250
Oh, Oh, Oh!

01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:04,443
My own personal flurry!

01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:10,770
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:14,841
Anna?

01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,844
But she froze your heart.

01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:19,771
The only frozen heart around here is yours.

01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:26,724
Wonderful!

01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:41,205
Setting course, sir.

01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:46,839
I will return this scoundrel to his country.

01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:50,761
We shall see what his twelve big brothers think of his behavior.

01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,479
Arendelle thanks you, milord.

01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,319
This is unacceptable.

01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:57,479
I am a victim of fear. I've been traumatized.

01:29:57,480 --> 01:29:59,364
Ah! My neck hurts.

01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:03,039
Is there a doctor that I could see?

01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:05,439
And I demand to see the queen!

01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,642
Oh. I have a message from the queen.

01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,919
"Arendelle will henceforth and forever

01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:14,045
"no longer do business of any sort with Weaseltown."

01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,239
"Weselton."

01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:16,799
It's Weselton!

01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:17,919
Come on, come on, come on!

01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,399
Okay, okay, here I come.

01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,489
Pole! - Whoops! Sorry.

01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:24,211
Okay, Okay.

01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:26,044
Here we are. Oh!

01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:30,363
I owe you a sled.

01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:35,204
Are you serious? - Yes!

01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:36,999
And it's the latest model.

01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,599
No, I can't accept this.

01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:41,565
You have to. No returns. No exchanges. Queen's orders.

01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:45,521
She's named you the Official Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer.

01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,519
What? That's not a thing. - Oh, sure it is.

01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:51,039
And it even has a cup holder. Do you like it?

01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:53,359
Like it? I love it!

01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,439
Whoa.

01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:56,290
I could kiss you!

01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,879
I could. I mean, I'd like to. I'd...

01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:01,079
May I? We me. I mean, may we?

01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:02,327
Wait, what?

01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:04,566
We may.

01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:09,926
Summer!

01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,799
Ooh...

01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,879
Hello.

01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:33,239
Are you ready?

01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:41,282
Ice!

01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:55,125
Swing me.

01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,804
Ooh...

01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,759
I like the open gates.

01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:02,122
We are never closing them again.

01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:07,127
Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful, but you know I don't skate.

01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:08,731
Come on! You can do it!

01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,359
Look out. Reindeer coming through.

01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,119
I got it, I got it. I don't got it, I don't got it.

01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:14,199
Hey, guys!

01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:15,519
That's it, Olaf.

01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:18,839
Glide and pivot. And glide and pivot.
