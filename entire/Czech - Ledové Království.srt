00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,639
Born of cold and winter air
Vzduch jak nůž a deště z hor...
[Air like a knife and rain from the mountains...]

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,999
And mountain rain combining
noc bílá zmrazí rázem,
[White night suddenly freezes,]

00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,159
This icy force both foul and fair
a my to srdce ledové
[and have the heart to ice]

00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,679
Has a frozen heart worth mining
v zimě tuhé dobýváme.
[Winter solid dig.]

00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,559
So cut through the heart
Jen je nelituj,
[Just a pity,]

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,039
Cold and clear
stůj a řež,
[stop a bloodbath,]

00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,159
Strike for love and strike for fear
strach z něj máš a necouvneš!
[fear of him and got necouvneš!]

00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,091
See the beauty sharp and sheer
Krásné, zrádné, s ním se rveš.
[Beautiful, treacherous, with him scream.]

00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,039
Split the ice apart
Srdce své si chraň,
[Protect your heart,]

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,040
And break the frozen heart
je pastí bílá pláň.
[it traps white plain.]

00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,488
Watch your step! Let it go!
Pozor dej! Pevně drž!
[Give Attention! Hold on tight!]

00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,968
Hup, ho
Hup! Hou...
[Hup! Hou...]

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,761
Watch your step! Let it go!
Pozor dej! Pevně drž!
[Give Attention! Hold on tight!]

00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,999
Beautiful! Powerful!
Krasavec! Láme vaz!
[Handsome! We break a leg!]

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,359
Dangerous! Cold!
Klouže jak! had!
[Slides how! Snake!]

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,679
Ice has a magic can't be controlled
Led mocí kouzelnou
vládne snad,

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,919
Stronger than one
silnější je,
[stronger,]

00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,281
Stronger than ten
opakuj to,
[repeat it,]

00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,039
Stronger than a hundred men!
silnější než chlapů sto!
[stronger than a hundred guys!]

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,399
Oh!

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,839
Born of cold and winter air
Vzduch jak nůž a deště z hor...
[Air like a knife and rain from the mountains...]

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,159
And mountain rain combining
noc bílá zmrazí rázem,
[White night suddenly freezes,]

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,559
This icy force both foul and fair
a my to srdce ledové
[and have the heart to ice]

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,445
Has a frozen heart worth mining
v zimě tuhé dobýváme.
[Winter solid dig.]

00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,719
Cut through the heart
Víš přece proč,
[You know why,]

00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,919
Cold and clear
stůj a řež,
[stop a bloodbath,]

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,282
Strike for love and strike for fear
strach z něj máš a necouvneš!
[fear of him and got necouvneš!]

00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,802
There's beauty and there's danger here
V něm krása je, v něm číhá smrt.
[The beauty of it is, there lurks death.]

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,122
Split the ice apart
Dobře chraň to své,
[Well that's forbid,]

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,410
Beware the frozen heart
zlom srdce ledové!
[Heart break the ice!]

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,127
Come on, Sven.
Poběž, Svene!

Elsa. Psst!
Elso.

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,565
Elsa!
Elso!
[Elso!]

00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,888
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up!
Vstávej, vstávej, vstávej!
[Get up, get up, get up!]

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,521
Anna, go back to sleep.
Anno, běž spinkat.
[Anna, go beddy.]

00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,008
I just can't.
Ale já nemůžu.
[But I can not.]

00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,125
The sky is awake, so I'm awake.
Obloha nespí, já taky nespím.
[Sky sleeps, I do not sleep well.]

00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,279
So, we have to play.
Chci si hrát.
[I want to play.]

00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,239
Go play by yourself.
Běž si hrát sama!
[Go play alone!]

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,448
Do you want to build a snowman?
Postavíme sněhuláka?
[We build a snowman?]

00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,039
Come on, come on, come on!
Honem, honem, honem!
[Hurry, hurry, hurry!]

00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,049
Do the magic! Do the magic!
Čaruj! No tak čaruj!
[Čaruj! Well čaruj!]

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,686
Oh...

00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,129
- Ready? - Uh-huh.
Můžu?
[Can I?]

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,329
This is amazing!
To je paráda!
[That's great!]

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,411
Watch this!
Koukej se.
[Look down.]

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,839
Hi, I'm Olaf, and I like warm hugs.
Ahoj, já jsem Olaf. A mám rád vřelá objetí.
[Hi, I'm Olaf. And I like a warm embrace.]

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,644
I love you, Olaf!
Jsi boží, Olafe.
[You are God, Olaf.]

00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,084
Olaf...

00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,601
Tickle bumps!
Kopečky.
[Scoops.]

00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,046
Oh!

00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,761
Hang on!
Pozor!
[Beware!]

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,039
Catch me!
Chyť mě!
[Catch me!]

00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,079
Gotcha!
Mám tě.
[I have you.]

00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,486
Again!
Ještě!
[Yet!]

00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,801
Wait!
Počkej.
[Wait.]

00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,687
- Whoo-hoo! - Slow down!
Zpomal!
[Slow down!]

00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,839
Whoo!

00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,246
Anna!
Anno!
[Anna!]

00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,726
Anna!
Anno?
[Anna?]

00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,243
Mama! Papa!
Mami, tati!
[Mom, Dad!]

00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,404
No, no...

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,399
You're okay, Anna. I got you.
To nic, Anno. Jsem s tebou.
[It's okay, Anna. I'm with you.]

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,046
Elsa, what have you done?
Elso, co jsi to provedla?
[Elso, what have you done?]

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,130
This is getting out of hand.
Tohle už je příliš.
[This is too much.]

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,599
It was an accident. I'm sorry, Anna!
Já za to nemůžu. Promiň mi to, Anno.
[It is not my fault. Forgive me, Annie.]

00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,299
Oh. She's ice cold.
Je tak chladná.
[It is so cold.]

00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,565
I know where we have to go.
Já vím, co udělat.
[I know what to do.]

00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,646
Ice?
Led?
[Led?]

00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,119
Faster, Sven.
Přidej, Svene!
[Add, Sven!]

00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,321
Sven!
Svene.
[Sven.]

00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,282
Please! Help! It's my daughter.
Prosím, pomozte! Jde o mou dcerku.
[Please help! As for my daughter.]

00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,679
It's the king.
To je král.
[That is king.]

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,439
Trolls?
Trollové?
[Trolls?]

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,005
Shush! I'm trying to listen.
Chci to slyšet.
[I want to hear it.]

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,171
Cuties. I'm going to keep you.
Jste sladcí. Vás si nechám.
[You are sweet. I'll keep.]

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,645
Your Majesty.
Veličenstvo.
[Majesty.]

00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,679
Born with the powers, or cursed?
S magií narozena, či byla prokleta?
[The magic was born, and was cursed?]

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,201
Born. And they're getting stronger.
Narozena. A stále to sílí.
[Born. And it's still growing.]

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,731
Here, here.
Mohu?
[I can?]

00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,564
You are lucky it wasn't her heart.
Štěstí, že to není srdce.
[Lucky it's not the heart.]

00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,930
The heart is not so easily changed.
Srdce se mění velice těžko.
[Heart change very difficult.]

00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,726
But the head can be persuaded.
Ale hlavu lze přesvědčit.
[But the head can be persuaded.]

00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,610
Do what you must.
Udělej, co je třeba.
[Do what's necessary.]

00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,286
I recommend we remove all magic.
Doporučuji odstranit veškerou magii.
[I recommend to remove all magic.]

00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,042
Even memories of magic, to be safe.
Včetně vzpomínek na ni. Pro jistotu.
[Including memories of her. For sure.]

00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,009
But don't worry. I'll leave the fun.
Ale nebojte. Vše hezké zůstane.
[But do not worry. Everything stays nice.]

00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,411
She will be okay.
Bude v pořádku.
[He's going to be ok.]

00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,088
But she won't remember I have powers?
A zapomene i to, že umím kouzlit?
[And forget the fact that I can do magic?]

00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,959
It's for the best.
Je to tak lepší.
[It's better that way.]

00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,484
Listen to me, Elsa. Your power will only grow.
Poslouchej mě, Elso. Tvoje moc bude sílit.
[Listen to me, Elso. Your power will grow.]

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,039
There is beauty in it...
Je v ní mnoho krásy,
[It contains a lot of beauty,]

00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,359
But also great danger.
ale i velkého nebezpečí.
[but also of great danger.]

00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,881
You must learn to control it.
Musíš se ji naučit ovládat.
[You gotta learn to control it.]

00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,763
Fear will be your enemy.
Strach bude tvůj nepřítel.
[Fear is your enemy.]

00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,761
No!
Ne.
[No.]

00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,319
We'll protect her.
My ji ochráníme.
[We will protect her.]

00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,599
She can learn to control it. I'm sure.
Naučí se to krotit, určitě.
[They learn to tame it, certainly.]

00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,159
Until then...
A do té doby...
[Until then...]

00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,044
We'll lock the gates.
...zavřeme brány.
[... close the gates.]

00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,599
We'll reduce the staff.
Propustíme služebnictvo.
[We release servants.]

00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,087
We will limit her contact with people,
Přestane se stýkat s lidmi
[Stop socializing with people]

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,244
and keep her powers hidden from everyone.
a o její kouzelné moci nikomu neřekneme.
[and on her magical power will not tell anyone.]

00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,370
Including Anna.
Ani Anně.
[Neither Anna.]

00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,566
Elsa?
Elso?
[Elso?]

00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,045
Do you wanna build a snowman?
Ráda sněhuláky stavíš,
[Glad you build snowmen,]

00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,847
Come on, let's go and play
tak pojď si se mnou hrát!
[so come play with me!]

00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,803
I never see you any more
Já už tě skoro nevídám,
[I almost never see you anymore,]

00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,246
Come out the door
a proč jsi tam?
[and why are you there?]

00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,006
It's like you've gone away
To se tě musím ptát!
[That I have to ask!]

00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,121
We used to be best buddies, and now we're not
Jsme vůbec ještě sestry, a nebo ne?
[We did not have sisters or not?]

00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,201
I wish you would tell me why
Chci být s tebou napořád!
[I want to be with you forever!]

00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,166
Do you wanna build a snowman?
Ráda sněhuláky stavíš
[Glad you build snowmen]

00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,959
It doesn't have to be a snowman
a mě i koulování baví.
[and I even enjoy a snowball fight.]

00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,719
Go away, Anna.
Běž pryč, Anno.
[Go away, Anna.]

00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,730
Okay, bye
No tak ne.
[Well, do not.]

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,091
The gloves will help.
Rukavice ti pomohou.
[The gloves will help you.]

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,479
See? Conceal it.
Vidíš? Co nevidíš...
[See? What you see...]

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,119
Don't feel it.
...to necítíš.
[... feel it.]

00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,924
Don't let it show.
A nikdo nic neví.
[And nobody knows anything.]

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,639
Do you wanna build a snowman?
Ráda sněhuláky stavíš
[Glad you build snowmen]

00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,959
Or ride our bike around the halls?
a skvěle jezdíš po schodech!
[a great ride up the stairs!]

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,159
I think some company is overdue
Mně chybí, Elso, tvoje společnost.
[I miss, Elso, your company.]

00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,199
I've started talking to the pictures on the walls
Už mluvím s obrazy na zaprášených zdech.
[I am speaking with dusty pictures on the walls.]

00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,279
Hang in there, Joan.
Nespadni, Johanko.
[Do not fall, Joan.]

00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,962
It gets a little lonely, all these empty rooms
A je mi tady smutno, někdy mám i strach
[And here I am sad, sometimes I even fear]

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,891
Just watching the hours tick by
v těch předlouhých minutách.
[in those předlouhých minutes.]

00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,159
I'm scared.
Bojím se.
[I'm afraid.]

00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,239
It's getting stronger!
Je to čím dál silnější.
[It's getting stronger.]

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,079
Getting upset only makes it worse. Calm down.
Rozčilování to jen zhoršuje. Uklidni se.
[Aggravation is only getting worse. Calm down.]

00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,879
No! Don't touch me!
Ne! Nesahej na mě!
[No! Do not touch me!]

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,208
Please, I don't want to hurt you.
Prosím, nechci ti ublížit.
[Please, I do not want to hurt you.]

00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,884
See you in two weeks!
Nashle za dva týdny.
[See you in two weeks.]

00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,161
Do you have to go?
Musíte odjet?
[You have to go?]

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,569
You'll be fine, Elsa.
Neměj strach, Elso.
[Do not worry, Elso.]

00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,525
Your Highness.

00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,841
Elsa?
Elso?
[Elso?]

00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,087
Please, I know you're in there
Vím, že jsi tam, vím to,
[I know you're there, I know,]

00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,647
People are asking where you've been
lidi se ptávají, kde jsi.
[people with ptávají where you are.]

00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,529
They say "Have courage", and I'm trying to
Prý ať jsem silná, a já snažím se,
[Apparently whatever I'm strong and I'm trying to]

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,799
I'm right out here for you
když vím, jak blízko jsme.
[I know how close we are.]

00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,207
Just let me in
Kdo k tobě smí?
[Who is allowed to you?]

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,250
We only have each other; it's just you and me
Vždyť máme jedna druhou, samy jsme, my dvě.
[After all, we have each other, we own two of us.]

00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,771
What are we gonna do?
Čeká nás spousta dnů.
[We have a lot of days.]

00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,440
Do you wanna build a snowman?
Ráda sněhuláky stavíš.
[Glad you build snowmen.]

00:11:40,092 --> 00:11:44,345
.
O tři roky později
[Three years later]

00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,279
All ashore!
Všichni na břeh!

The gates will be opening soon.
Za chvíli otevřou brány.
[For the moment opens its gates.]

00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,919
Why do I have to wear this?
Proč se musím takhle strojit?
[Why do I dress like this?]

00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,159
Because the queen has come of age.
Protože královna je už plnoletá
[Because the queen is already of age]

It's Coronation Day!

00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,009
That's not my fault.
Ale za to já nemůžu.
[But beyond that I can not.]

00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,319
What do you want, Sven?
Copak bys rád, Svene?
[Do you like Sven?]

00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,639
"Give me a snack."
Něco na zoubek.

What's the magic word?
A co kouzelné slůvko?
[What's the magic word?]

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,399
"Please."
Prosím.
[Please.]

00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,489
Uh! Uh-uh-uh. Share.
Poděl se.
[Share it.]

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,039
I can't believe they're finally opening up the gates!
Nemůžu uvěřit, že konečně otevírají brány.
[I can not believe they finally opened the gates.]

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,881
And for a whole day! Faster, Percy!
A na celý dlouhý den. Pospěš, Percy!
[And all day long. Hurry, Percy!]

Did I say that out loud?
Že já to řekl nahlas?
[That you say that out loud?]

00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,519
Oh! Me sore eyes can't wait to see the queen and the princess.
Už se nemůžu dočkat, až uvidím královnu a princeznu.

00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,679
I bet they are absolutely lovely.
Určitě jsou to obě krasavice.

00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,882
I bet they are beautiful.
Vsaď se, že budou nádherné.

Princess Anna?
Princezno Anno?

Huh? Yeah?
Jo?

00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,879
Sorry to wake you, ma'am.
Nerad vás budím, madam...
[I hate to wake you, ma'am...]

00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,719
No, no, no, you didn't.
Ne, ne, nespím.
[No, no, I do not sleep.]

00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,490
I've been up for hours.
Už jsem dávno vzhůru.
[I've long since up.]

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,166
Who is it?
Kdo je tam?
[Who is there?]

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,879
Still me, ma'am.
To jsem stále já, madam.
[I'm still me, ma'am.]

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,759
The gates will open soon. Time to get ready.
Otevíráme brány. Musíte se ustrojit.
[We open the gate. You have to be dressed.]

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,839
Of course.
Ovšem.
[Of course.]

00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,079
Ready for what?
Ustrojit na co?

So's that door!
...dokořán!
[... wide!]

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,879
I didn't know they did that any more
Kdy bylo to tak, marně vzpomínám!
[When it was so vain I remember!]

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,130
Who knew we owned 8,000 salad plates?
Kdo viděl osm tisíc talířů?
[Who saw eight thousand plates?]

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,962
For years I've roamed these empty halls
Můj křik se prázdnou chodbou nes',
[My screams empty corridor nes']

00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,562
Why have a ballroom with no balls?
k čemu je sál, když není ples?
[what is the hall when no ball?]

00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,965
Finally, they're opening up the gates!
Otevřem teď brány kejklířům!
[Now open the gates jugglers!]

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,799
There'll be actual, real, live people
Přijdou lidé opravdoví,
[People come true,]

00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,799
It'll be totally strange
to bude nezvyklá věc!
[It will be an unusual thing!]

But wow! Am I so ready for this change!
Ty změny dnešek změní v blázinec!
[These changes tonight turns into a madhouse!]

00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,649
'Cause for the first time in forever
Je to tu právě teď, tak krásné,
[It's here right now, so beautiful,]

00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,359
There'll be music, there'll be light
samá hudba, světel zář!
[same music, lights glow!]

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,802
For the first time in forever
A všem právě teď jak hvězdám
[And all now how stars]

00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,848
I'll be dancing through the night
budou v tanci tváře plát!
[they dance cheek plate!]

00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,999
Don't know if I'm elated or gassy
Jsem vzrušená a bolí mě tady,
[I'm excited and hurt me here,]

00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,965
But I'm somewhere in that zone
asi shoří hlava má!
[probably burn my head!]

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,002
'Cause for the first time in forever
Vždyť svět mi právě teď jak švihák
[For the world to me right now as a dandy]

00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,799
I won't be alone
ruku podává.
[hand made.]

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,810
I can't wait to meet everyone!
Už se těším, až každého poznám.
[I look forward to everyone I know.]

00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,139
What if I meet The One?
Možná potkám i toho pravého.
[Maybe even I meet Mr. Right.]

00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,319
Tonight, imagine me gown and all
Dnes poprvé hezky v parádě...
[Today, for the first time in the parade nicely...]

00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,639
Fetchingly draped against the wall
šarmantně o zeď opřená
[charmingly leaning against the wall]

00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,164
The picture of sophisticated grace
se změním v krásku se vší noblesou!
[will turn into a beauty with all the nobility!]

00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,639
I suddenly see him standing there
Pak zničehonic mě osloví
[Then suddenly I appeal]

00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,959
A beautiful stranger, tall and fair
ten krasavec plavý ze snů mých
[the blond beauty of my dreams]

00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,639
I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face!
ať pralinky hned slepí pusu mou!
[whether pralines immediately bonded kiss me!]

00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,359
But then we laugh and talk all evening
A pak se tomu zasmějeme,
[And then we would laugh,]

00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,639
Which is totally bizarre
prokecáme celý bál!
[prokecáme all scared!]

00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,845
Nothing like the life I've led so far
Život půjde jinak dál a dál!
[Otherwise life will go on and on!]

00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,205
For the first time in forever
Vím, že právě teď a navždy
[I know that now and forever]

00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,883
There'll be magic, there'll be fun
malá kouzla nadchnou nás.
[Small charms enchant us.]

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,364
For the first time in forever
Vím, že právě teď mi každý
[I know that right now my every]

00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:23,083
I could be noticed by someone
chce šeptat: Hledám právě vás!
[I want to whisper, looking for you!]

00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,767
And I know it is totally crazy
Vím, že opravdu šíleně zní to,
[I know it sounds really crazy,]

00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,401
To dream I'd find romance
hned lásky dar si přát!
[just love the gift you wish!]

00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,409
But for the first time in forever
Já ale právě teď jsem šťastná,
[But right now I'm happy,]

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,487
At least I've got a chance!
smím srdci šanci dát.
[I may give the heart a chance.]

00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,969
{\an8}Don't let them in
Kdo přijde dnes,
[Who arrives today]

00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,402
{\an8}Don't let them see
má uvěřit,
[He has to believe]

00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,930
{\an8}Be the good girl you always have to be
že jsem dívkou, jakou jsem měla být.
[I'm a girl, I'd be.]

00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,251
{\an8}Conceal, don't feel
Skrývej city,
[Of hiding emotions,]

00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,443
{\an8}Put on a show
je to jen hra!
[its only a game!]

00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,891
{\an8}Make one wrong move and everyone will know
Jen chybný krok a hra by propadla!
[Only misstep, and the game would fail!]

00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,719
{\an8}But it's only for today
Ale bude to jen dnes.
[But it will be just today.]

00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,249
It's only for today
A bude to jen dnes!
[And it's just today!]

00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,685
{\an8}It's agony to wait
Kdo čekání má snést?
[Who should bear the wait?]

00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,685
It's agony to wait
Kdo čekání má snést?
[Who should bear the wait?]

00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,691
{\an8}Tell the guards to open up
Stráže, brány otevřte!
[Guards, gates open!]

00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,928
{\an8}The gate
Ať zvou!
[Whether invite!]

00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,928
The gate
Ať zvou!
[Whether invite!]

00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,599
For the first time in forever
Je tu právě teď ta chvíle...
[It's now the moment...]

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,409
{\an8}Don't let them in, don't let them see
Kdo přijde dnes, má uvěřit...
[Whoever comes today, has to believe...]

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,439
I'm getting what I'm dreaming of
kdy sny mé pravdou stanou se!
[where my dreams become true!]

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,079
{\an8}Be the good girl you always have to be
že jsem dívkou, jakou jsem měla být.
[I'm a girl, I'd be.]

00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,399
A chance to change my lonely world
Mám šanci s láskou měnit svět...
[I have the chance to change the world with love...]

00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,399
{\an8}Conceal
Skrývej.
[Of hiding.]

00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:39,799
A chance to find true love
...s tou pravou láskou svou.
[... with the true love of mine.]

00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,959
{\an8}Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Jen skrývej city, všichni lžou.
[Only of hiding emotions, everybody lies.]

00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,959
I know it all ends tomorrow
A zítra už bude pozdě,
[And tomorrow will be too late,]

00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,970
So it has to be today!
všechno stát se musí dnes!
[all happen to be today!]

00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,968
'Cause for the first time in forever
Vždyť mně je právě teď tak sladce!
[For me right now is so sweet!]

00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:56,362
For the first time in forever
Srdce právě teď mě k lásce
[Now my heart to love]

00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,325
Nothing's in my way!
cestou svou má vést.

Are you sure?
Opravdu?
[Really?]

00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,919
Yeah. I just wasn't looking where I was going.
Ano. Nekoukala jsem na cestu.
[Yes. I was not looking at the road.]

00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,202
But I'm great, actually.
Nic mi není. Opravdu.
[It's nothing. Really.]

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,489
Oh... Thank goodness.
Díkybohu.
[Thank God.]

Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa...

00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,845

Oh, boy!
Propána.
[For Mr.]

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,039
This is awkward.
To je trapné.
[That is embarrassing.]

00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,719
Not "You're awkward", but just because we're...
Ne že vy jste trapný.
[Not that you're lame.]

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,241
I'm awkward, you're gorgeous. Wait, what?
To já jsem trapná. Vy jste fešák. To je co?

I'm not that princess.
Taková princezna nejsem.

00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,879
Because I don't think I'm supposed to...
Nejsem si jistá.
[I'm not sure.]

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,320
Oh. Okay.
Tak jo.
[So yeah.]

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,447
Hi.
Ahoj.
[Hey.]

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,444
"Hi" me? Oh...
To je na mě?
[This is for me?]

00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,330
Um... Hi.
Ahoj.
[Hey.]

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,359
You look beautiful.
Překypuješ krásou.
[Překypuješ beauty.]

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,479
Thank you. You look beautiful-ler.
Díky. Ty taky překypuješ.
[Thanks. You too překypuješ.]

00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,039
I mean, not "fuller." You don't look fuller.
Tedy ne že jsi tlustá,
[Not that you're fat,]

00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,159
But more beautiful.
myslím, jako že jsi moc hezká.
[I like that you're too nice.]

00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,169
Thank you.
Děkuji.
[Thank you.]

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,526
So...
Aha.
[I see.]

00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,609
This is what a party looks like.
Takhle vypadá královský bál.
[He looks like a royal ball.]

00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,399
It's warmer than I thought.
Je tu nějak moc teplo.
[There's too much heat.]

00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,679
What is that amazing smell?
Co je to za úžasnou vůni?
[What is that wonderful smell?]

00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,726
Chocolate.
Čokoláda.
[Chocolate.]

00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,920
Your Majesty.
Vaše Výsosti...
[Your Highness...]

00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,045
The Duke of Weaseltown.
Vévoda z Kradákova.
[Duke of Kradákova.]

00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,044
"Weselton"! Duke of Weselton, Your Majesty.
"Kravákova"! Vévoda z Kravákova, Vaše Výsosti.
[" Kravákova"! Duke of Kravákova, Your Highness.]

00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,679
As your closest partner in trade it seems only fitting
Jsem váš nejbližší obchodní partner, a tak se jistě sluší,
[I'm your closest trading partner, so it certainly behooves]

00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,650
that I offer you your first dance as queen.
abych vás vyzval k tanci jako první.
[I invite you to dance first.]

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,365
One-two, and jump.
Raz, dva, a hop.
[One, two, and hop.]

00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,881
Uh...

00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,919
Thank you. Only, I don't dance.
Děkuji vám. Bohužel netančím.
[Thank you. Unfortunately dance.]

00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,199
Oh...

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,239
But my sister does.
Ale má sestra ano.
[But my sister did.]

00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,599
What? - Oh! Lucky you.
Cože? - Máte štěstí.
[What? - You're lucky.]

00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,719
Oh, I don't think...
Já myslím, že...
[I think that...]

00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,127
If you swoon, let me know. I'll catch you.
Kdybyste omdlévala, dejte vědět, chytím vás.
[If you faint, let me know, I'll catch you.]

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:34,839
Sorry.
Promiň.
[Sorry.]

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,719
Like an agile peacock.
Umím tančit jako páv.
[I can dance like a peacock.]

00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,639
Ow! Ow.

00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,719
Speaking of, so great to have the gates open.
Mimochodem, je skvělé, že jste otevřeli brány.
[Anyway, it's great that you've opened the gates.]

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,922
Why did they shut them in the first place?
Proč byly vůbec zavřené?
[Why were not closed?]

00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,719
Do you know the reason? Hmm?
Víte, z jakého důvodu?
[Do you know why?]

00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,559
No.
Ne.
[No.]

00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,091
All right. Hang on!
Dobrá. Držte se.
[All right. Brace yourself.]

00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,919
They don't call me the "Little Dipper" for nothing!
Neříkají mi "Splašený špunt" pro nic za nic.
[They do not call me" Crazy stopper" for nothing.]

00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,079
Oh-ho!

00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,727
Like a chicken with the face of a monkey, I fly.
Jsem jako kohout s tváří opice. Létám.
[I like cock -faced monkeys. I'm flying.]

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,719
Let me know when you're ready
Dejte mi vědět,
[Let me know,]

00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,919
for another round, Milady.
až se budete cítit na další kolo.
[when you feel the next round.]

00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,851
Well, he was sprightly.
To je ale čipera.
[But this is nimbler.]

00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,079
Especially for a man in heels.
A to má ještě boty s kramfleky.
[And he has even shoes with heel.]

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,850
Are you okay?
Jsi celá?
[You all right?]

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,649
I've never been better. This is so nice.
Nikdy mi nebylo lépe. Je to nádhera.
[Never better. It's beautiful.]

00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,122
I wish it could be like this all the time.
Chtěla bych, aby to tak bylo napořád.
[I want to be like that forever.]

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,960
Me, too.
Já také.
[I also.]

00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,679
But it can't.
Ale nejde to.
[But I can not.]

00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,882
Why not? - It just can't.
Proč ne? - Prostě to nejde.
[Why not? - I just can not.]

00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,770
Excuse me for a minute.
Omluv mne na moment.
[Excuse me for a moment.]

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,249
I'd be honored.

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,881
Glad I caught you.
Tak jsem vás chytil.
[I caught you.]

00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,326
Hans.
Hansi.
[Hansi.]

00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,679
I often had a whole parlor to myself to slide!
Rozběhla jsem se chodbou a klouzala dál.
[I ran down the hall and slid away.]

00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,719
Oops!

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,119
Sorry.
Pardon.
[Sorry.]

00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,519
Your physique helps, I'm sure, too.
Ještěže na to máš postavu.
[Luckily it got character.]

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,006
Ah.

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,479
What's this?
Co je tohle?
[What is this?]

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,959
Uh, I was born with it.
To mám od narození.
[I have it from birth.]

00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,367
Although, I dreamed I was kissed by a troll.
I když se mi kdysi zdálo, že mě políbil troll.
[Although I once dreamed that I kissed a troll.]

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,799
I like it.
Moc hezké.
[Very nice.]

00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,479
Yeah, the whole thing.
Ano, sněz to celé.
[Yes, eat it whole.]

00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,761
You got it.
Dokázals to.
[You did it.]

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,766
Okay, wait, wait. So, you have how many brothers?
Takže počkej. Kolik že máš bratrů?
[So wait. How many brothers do you have that?]

00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,889
Twelve older brothers.
Dvanáct, všichni jsou starší.
[Twelve, they're all older.]

00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:26,519
Three of them pretended I was invisible, literally, for two years.
Tři z nich se dva roky tvářili, že vůbec neexistuju.
[Three of them for two years pretended not exist at all.]

00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,846
That's horrible.
To je příšerné.
[This is horrible.]

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,486
It's what brothers do.
To už bratři dělávají.
[That's brothers do.]

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,211
And sisters.
I sestry.
[Even nurses.]

00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,719
Elsa and I were really close when we were little.
Jako malé jsme si byly s Elsou blízké,
[As a small, we were Elsa loved ones]

00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,199
But then, one day, she just shut me out,
ale pak mi zavřela dveře před nosem
[but then he closed the door in his face]

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,721
and I never knew why.
a já ani nevím proč.
[and I do not know why.]

00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,199
I would never shut you out.
To já bych nikdy neudělal.
[That I would never do that.]

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,161
Okay, can I just say something crazy?
Můžu říct něco bláznivého?
[Can I say something crazy?]

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,766
{\an8}I love crazy.
Mám rád blázniviny.
[I like crazy.]

00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,649
All my life has been a series of doors in my face
Život vždycky dveřmi před nosem práskne mi hned,
[Life always slam the door in my face me now,]

00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,599
And then suddenly I bump into you
a dnes najednou dveřmi vejdeš ty.
[and now all of a sudden you walk through the door you are.]

00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,959
{\an8}I was thinking the same thing, because, like...
Přesně to mě napadlo, protože...
[That's exactly what I thought, because...]

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,209
{\an8}I've been searching my whole life to find my own place
Chci mít taky svoje místo, hledám svůj svět!
[I want to take my place, too, seeking your world!]

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,959
{\an8}And maybe it's the party talking, or the chocolate fondue
A možná oslavou jsem zmámen, a tím sladkým fondue.
[And maybe I was a celebration of stupor, and the sweet fondue.]

00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,079
But with you
S tebou já...
[With you I...]

00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,719
{\an8}But with you I found my place
S tebou já už vím, kým jsem!
[With you I already know who I am!]

00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,039
I see your face
...jen divím se!
[I wonder... just!]

00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:17,039
And it's nothing like I've ever known before
Dveře dokořán a napořád, se zdá,
[Doors open and forever, it seems,]

00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,409
Love is an open door!
otevře láska má!
[Love has opened!]

00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,039
Love is an open door!
Otevře láska má!
[Love has opened!]

00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,719
Love is an open door
Otevře láska má!
[Love has opened!]

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,479
With you
S tebou!
[With you!]

00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,445
Love is an open door
Otevře láska má!
[Love has opened!]

00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,159
{\an8}I mean, it's crazy
Ty dopovíš to...
[They dopovíš it...]

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,459
What?
Co?
[What?]

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,522
{\an8}We finish each other's
No to co jsem nakous'.
[Well, what I nakous'.]

00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,022
Sandwiches
Sendviče!
[Sandwiches!]

00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,759
{\an8}That's what I was gonna say!
Přesně to chci říct!
[That's exactly what I mean!]

00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,959
I've never met someone
Ne, neznám nikoho,
[No, you do not know anyone,]

00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,079
Who thinks so much like me
kdo přemýšlí jak já!
[who thinks as I do!]

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,559
Jinx! Jinx again!
Trefa. A zase!
[Fluke. And again!]

00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,259
Our mental synchronization
Jsme dvojčata, mozek jeden,
[We're twins, one brain,]

00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,209
Can have but one explanation
a na stejné lodi jedem,
[and in the same boat poison]

00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,450
You and I were just meant to be
Ty a já jsme vjednom dva.
[You and I are in one and two.]

00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,959
Say goodbye
Sbohem dám
[goodbye to give]

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,004
To the pain of the past
minulým bolestem,
[past pain,]

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,649
We don't have to feel it anymore
zamčené tvé dveře, jak se zdá,
[locked your door, it seems,]

00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,846
Love is an open door
otevře láska má.
[Love has opened.]

00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:19,199
Love is an open door!
Otevře láska má.
[Love has opened.]

00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,319
Life can be so much more
Otevře láska má!
[Love has opened!]

00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,319
With you
S tebou!
[With you!]

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,679
Love is an open
Otevře láska
[opens love]

00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,362
Door
má!
[It has!]

00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,649
{\an8}Can I say something crazy?
Můžu říct něco bláznivého?
[Can I say something crazy?]

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,644
{\an8}Will you marry me?
Vzala by sis mě?
[Would you married me?]

00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,844
Can I say something even crazier?
Můžu říct něco ještě bláznivějšího?
[I can say anything more foolish?]

00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,401
Yes!
Ano.
[Yes.]

00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,769
Coming through. Excuse me. Oh...

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,559
Pardon. Sorry. Oh!
Pardon.
[Sorry.]

00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,285
Can we just get around you there?
Mohli bychom se protáhnout?
[We could stretch?]

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,444
Thank you. Oh! There she is.
Děkuji. Tamhle je.
[Thank you. There it is.]

00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,639
Elsa!
Elso!
[Elso!]

00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,479
I mean, Queen. Me again. Um...
Chci říct... královno. To jsem zase já.
[I mean... queen. It's me again.]

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,287
May I present Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.
Smím ti představit prince Hanse z Jižních ostrovů?
[May I introduce Prince Hans of South Island?]

00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,170
Your Majesty.
Vaše Výsosti.
[Your Highness.]

00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,759
We would like...
Chceme požádat...
[We want to ask...]

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,879
Uh, your blessing...
...o požehnání...
[... a blessing...]

00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,004
Of our marriage.
...našeho sňatku.
[... our marriage.]

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,284
Marriage? - Yes!
Sňatku? - Ano!
[Marriage? - Yes!]

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,839
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
Promiňte, ale nechápu.
[Sorry, but I do not understand.]

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,159
Well, we haven't worked out all the details ourselves.
Podrobnosti jsme zatím příliš neřešili.
[Details are still too tackling.]

00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,079
We'll need a few days to plan the ceremony.
Naplánovat ceremoniál bude chvíli trvat,
[Plan the ceremony will take time]

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,399
Of course, we'll have soup, roast, and ice cream. And then...
ale určitě bude pečeně a zmrzlina a pak...
[but certainly will be roast and ice cream, and then...]

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,761
Wait. Would we live here?
Počkat. Budeme žít tady?
[Wait. We live here?]

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,999
Here? - Absolutely!
Tady? - Samo sebou.
[Here? - By itself.]

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,079
Anna!
Anno!
[Anna!]

00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,679
Oh! We can invite all twelve of your brothers to stay with us.
Pozveme všech tvých dvanáct bratrů, aby tu žili s námi.
[We invite all your twelve brothers to live here with us.]

00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,959
What? No, no, no.
Ne.
[No.]

00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,288
Of course we have the room......
Místa je tu všude dost.
[Place there abound.]

00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,319
Wait, slow down. No one's brothers are staying here.
Počkejte. Zpomalte. Ničí bratři tu bydlet nebudou
[Wait. Slow down. Destroys brothers live here do not]

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,885
No one is getting married.
a nebude ani žádná svatba.
[and will not be no wedding.]

00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,519
Wait, what?
Cože?
[What?]

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,564
May I talk to you, please? Alone.
Můžu s tebou mluvit, prosím? O samotě.
[Can I talk to you, please? Alone.]

00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,801
No. Whatever you have to say, you can say to both of us.
Ne. Chceš-li mi něco říct, řekni nám to oběma.
[No. If you want to tell me something, tell us both.]

00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,206
Fine. You can't marry a man you just met.
Fajn. Nemůžeš si vzít někoho, koho sotva znáš.
[Fine. You can not marry someone you hardly know.]

00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,239
You can if it's true love.
Můžeš, když ho miluješ.
[You can, if you loved him.]

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,239
Anna, what do you know about true love?
Anno, co ty víš o pravé lásce?
[Anna, what do you know about true love?]

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,359
More than you.
Víc než ty.
[More than you.]

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,199
All you know is how to shut people out.
Jediné, co umíš, je uzavírat se před lidmi.
[The only thing you can do is to conclude from the people.]

00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,171
You asked for my blessing, but my answer is no.
Žádáte mě o požehnání, ale já vám ho nedám.
[You're asking me a blessing, but I will not give it to you.]

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,799
Now, excuse me.
Ne, je mi líto.
[No, I'm sorry.]

00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,439
Your Majesty, if I may ease your...
Vaše Výsosti, mohu-li dodat...
[Your Highness, I might add...]

00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,722
No, you may not. And I think you should go.
Ne, nemůžete. A měl byste odejít.
[No you can not. And you should go.]

00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,839
The party is over. Close the gates.
Slavnost končí. Zavřete brány.
[Celebration ends. Close the gates.]

00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,919
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,599
Elsa, no, no! Wait.
Elso, ne. Počkej!
[Elso, no. Wait!]

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,801
Give me my glove!
Vrať mi tu rukavici.
[Give me the glove.]

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,719
Elsa, please, please.
Elso, prosím.
[Elso, please.]

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,604
I can't live like this anymore!
Já už takhle dál žít nechci.
[I no longer want to live like this anymore.]

00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,527
Then leave.
Tak odejdi.
[Then leave.]

00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,719
What did I ever do to you?
Co jsem ti kdy udělala?
[What have I ever done?]

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,919
Enough, Anna.
To stačí, Anno.
[That's enough, Annie.]

00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,168
No, why? Why do you shut me out?
Proč jsi ke mně tak chladná?
[Why are you so cold to me?]

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,885
Why do you shut the world out?
Proč jsi tak chladná ke světu?
[Why are you so cold to the world?]

00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,724
What are you so afraid of?
Čeho se pořád bojíš?
[What are you still afraid?]

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,690
I said, enough!
Řekla jsem, že stačí!
[I said that's enough!]

00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,206
Sorcery.
Čáry.
[Lines.]

00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,286
I knew there was something dubious going on here.
Já věděl od začátku, že tu něco neštymuje.
[I knew from the beginning that something neštymuje.]

00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,246
Elsa.
Elso?
[Elso?]

00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,441
There she is!
To je ona!
[That is her!]

00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,359
Yes! It is her!
Ano! To je ona!
[Yes! That is her!]

00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,686
Queen Elsa.
Královno Elso.
[Queen Elso.]

00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,450
Our beautiful queen!
Naše překrásná královna!
[Our beautiful queen!]

00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,928
Your Majesty? Are you all right?
Vaše Výsosti, jste v pořádku?
[Your Highness, are you okay?]

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,281
No.

00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,246
There she is! Stop her!
Tamhle je! Chyťte ji!
[There it is! Get her!]

00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,479
Please, just stay away from me. Stay away.
Prosím vás, nepřibližujte se. Jděte pryč!
[Please, stay away. Go away!]

Elsa, stop!
Elso, stůj!
[Elso, stop!]

00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,999
Anna!
Anno!
[Anna!]

00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,201
No.
Ne.
[No.]

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,166
The fjord.
Váš fjord.
[Your fjord.]

00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,924
Snow! Snow?
Sněží! Sněží?
[Snowing! Snowing?]

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,199
Yes, snow.

00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,119
Are you all right? - No.
Jsi v pořádku? - Ne.
[Are you okay? - No.]

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,765
Did you know?
Věděla jsi to?
[Did you know that?]

00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,487
No.
Ne.
[No.]

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,839
Look, it's snowing. It's snowing!
Ono sněží. Sněží!
[It snows. Snowing!]

00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,559
The queen has cursed this land!
Královna proklela svoji zem!
[Queen cursed my country!]

00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,799
She must be stopped! You have to go after her.
Musíme ji zastavit. Musíte ji zneškodnit.
[We have to stop her. You have to defuse it.]

00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,199
Wait, no!
Počkat, ne.
[Wait, no.]

00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,719
You! Is there sorcery in you, too?
Vy jste taky čarodějnice?
[You're a witch, too?]

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,359
Are you a monster, too?
A monstrum jako ona?
[A monster like her?]

00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,359
No, no. I'm completely ordinary.
Ne. Já jsem úplně obyčejná.
[No. I totally ordinary.]

00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,050
That's right, she is.
Přesně, obyčejná.
[Exactly common.]

00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,524
In the best way.
Myslím to v dobrém.
[I mean that in a good way.]

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,159
And my sister is not a monster.
Má sestra není monstrum.
[My sister is a monster.]

00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,799
She nearly killed me!
Málem mě zabila!
[He almost killed me!]

00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,399
You slipped on ice. - Her ice.
Uklouzl jste na ledu. - Na jejím.
[You slipped on ice. - On her.]

00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,841
It was an accident. She was scared.
Byla to nehoda. Byla vyděšená.
[It was an accident. She was terrified.]

00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,891
She didn't mean it. She didn't mean any of this.
Nechtěla to udělat, nic takového neplánovala.
[She did not do it, did not plan anything like that.]

00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,639
Tonight was my fault. I pushed her.
Byla to moje chyba. Já ji vyprovokovala.
[It was my fault. I provoked her.]

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,839
So, I'm the one

Bring me my horse, please.
Vyveďte mi koně, prosím.
[Bring me a horse, please.]

00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,126
Anna, no. It's too dangerous.
Anno, ne. Je to nebezpečné.
[Anna, do not. Its dangerous.]

00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,130
Elsa's not dangerous.

I'll bring her back, and I'll make this right.
Přivedu ji zpět a vše napravíme.
[I bring it back and fix everything.]

00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,359
I'm coming with you.
Pojedu s tebou.
[I'll go with you.]

00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,769
No, I need you here to take care of Arendelle.
Ne. Zůstaneš tady a postaráš se o Arendelle.
[No. You stay here and take care about Arendelle.]

00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,765
On my honor.
Spolehni se.
[Count on it.]

00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,445
I leave Prince Hans in charge.
Nyní tu bude vládnout princ Hans.
[Now there will reign Prince Hans.]

00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,125
Are you sure you can trust her?
Víš jistě, že jí můžeš věřit?
[You sure he can trust her?]

00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,171
I don't want you getting hurt.
Nechci, aby ti někdo ublížil.
[I do not want anyone hurt.]

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,801
She's my sister.
Je to má sestra.
[It's my sister.]

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,731
She would never hurt me.
Mně by neublížila.
[It would not hurt.]

00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,980
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,
Na vrcholchích v noci panuje sníh,
The snow rules on the hilltops at night,

00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,980
not a footprint to be seen
ani stopa po lidech
not a footprint to be seen

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,480
A kingdom of isolation,
Ta samota královstvím je,
The loneliness of the kingdom in which

00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,980
and it looks like I'm the queen
královnou jsem vloček všech
I am the queen of all the snowflakes

The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Už kvílí vítr a hřmí bouře v srdci mém
The wind is howling and the storm is thundering in my heart

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:50,980
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried
Zlobu vyšeptám v tichu mrazivém
I'll whisper out my anger in the chilling silence

00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,980
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Já byla v zámku vězněná
I was trapped in a castle

00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:59,480
Be the good girl you always had to be
skrývej city, buď skříňka zamčená,
hide your feelings, be a locked box

00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,980
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
To táta chtěl, ty dny pryč jsou
That's what my dad wanted, those days are gone

00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,980
Well, now they know!
Svět zná tvář mou!

00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,980
Let it go, let it go!
Najednou, najednou!
Suddenly, suddenly!

00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:15,980
Can't hold it back any more!
chci skončit s tou hloupou hrou
I want to end the stupid game

00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,480
Let it go, let it go!

Turn away and slam the door!
dveřmi prásknu za sebou
I'll slam the door behind myself

I don't care what they're going to say
Já jsem svá, to chci dokázat všem
I'm myself, I want to prove that to everyone

Let the storm rage on
V bouři rozkvétám
I'm blooming in the storm

00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,980
The cold never bothered me anyway.
a mráz v duši vítězí nad sluncem.
And the cold in my soul wins over the sun.

00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,480
It's funny how some distance
Je zvláštní jak z té dálky,
It's funny how from the distance,

00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,980
Makes everything seem small
se všechno menší zdá
everything seems smaller

00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,980
And the fears that once controlled me
I ten strach co ve mně vládnul
Even the fear that once controlled me

00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:54,980
Can't get to me at all!
je loutka bezmocná!
is a helpless puppet!

00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,980
It's time to see what I can do
Jen vyzkouším, jak mocná jsem
I'll just try how powerful I am

00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,480
To test the limits and break through
A k výšinám mě zvedne zem
And the ground will raise me to heights

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,480
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
V své říši bez konce chci žít
I want to live forever in my kingdom

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,480
I'm free!
klid mít!
in peace!

00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:13,480
Let it go, let it go!
Najednou, najednou!
Suddenly, suddenly!

00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,480
I am one with the wind and sky
volná jsem, kráčím oblohou
I am free, I'm walking through the sky

00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,980
Let it go, let it go!
Najednou, najednou!
Suddenly, suddenly!

00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:24,980
You'll never see me cry
mé slzy šperkem jsou
my tears are my jewelry

00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:31,480
Here I stand, and here I'll stay,
Já jsem svá, jsem hráč i rváč
I'm myself, I'm both the player and the fighter

00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,980
Let the storm rage on...
V bouři rozkvétám...
I'm blooming in the storm...

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:48,980
My power flurries through the air and to the ground
Moc má se vzduchem vznáší v proudu neznámém
My power is floating through the air in an unknown flow

00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:55,980
My soul is spiralling in frozen fractals all around
A chladná duše září v krystalcích jak diadém
And the cold soul is shining in the crystals like a tiara

00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,980
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
Mé myšlenky se tříští, jedna smysl má
My thoughts are fragmented, only one makes sense

00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,480
I'm never going back
Je pasé minulost,
The past is passé,

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,480
The past is in the past!
když svítat začíná!
when it begins to dawn!

00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,480
Let it go, let it go!
Najednou, najednou!
Suddenly, suddenly!

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,480
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
úsvit dává mi sílu svou
the dawn is giving me its power

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,980
Let it go, let it go!
Najednou, najednou!
Suddenly, suddenly!

00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:25,480
That perfect girl is gone
už nejsem dívenkou
I'm not a little girl any more

00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:34,480
Here I stand in the light of day
Já jsem svá, křídla má hlas můj
I'm myself, my voice has wings

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,980
Let the storm rage on!
V bouři rozkvétám!
I'm blooming in the storm!

The cold never bothered me anyway.
Chci žít v zimě bez konce život svůj.

I'm sorry. It's all my fault.
Omlouvám se, je to moje chyba.
[I'm sorry, it's my fault.]

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,079
Of course, none of it would have happened
Nic z toho by se nestalo,

if she had just told me her secret.

Okay.
Tak fajn.

Snow. It had to be snow.
Sníh. Musel to být zrovna sníh.
[Snow. It had to be just snow.]

She couldn't have had tropical magic

00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,002
Oh. Great. For now, um, how about boots?
Bezva. Ale nemáte spíš boty?
[Cool. But you have more shoes?]

00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,324
Winter boots? And dresses?
Sněhule? A kožichy?
[Snowboots? A fur coats?]

00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,769
That would be in our winter department.
Zkuste naše zimní oddělení.
[Try our winter Department.]

00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,131
Oh. Um...

00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,799
I was just wondering.
Řekněte mi...
[Tell me...]

00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,048
Has another young woman...
Neprošla tudy ještě jiná
[Undergone yet another way]

00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,719
The queen perhaps, I don't know,
mladá žena, třeba královna...
[A young woman, perhaps a queen...]

00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,959
passed through here?
nebo tak něco?
[or something like that?]

00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,439
Only one crazy enough to be out in this storm
Jediný šílenec, který se toulá v bouři,
[Only a madman who wanders in the storm,]

00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,449
is you, dear.
jste vy.
[you.]

00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,479
You and this fellow.
A tenhle chlapík.
[And this guy.]

00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,519
Hoo-hoo.

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,846
Big summer blowout.
Mám letní výprodej.
[I have a summer sale.]

00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,999
Carrots.
Mrkve.
[Carrots.]

00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,326
Huh?

00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,251
Behind you.
Za tebou.
[Behind you.]

00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,569
Oh! Right. Excuse me.
Jistě. Promiň.
[Sure. Sorry.]

00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,842
Oh. A real howler in July, yes?
To je ale sibérie, že?
[But this is Siberia that?]

00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,404
Wherever could it be coming from?
Odkud se to asi bere?
[Where it probably takes?]

00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,611
The North Mountain.
Od Severní hory.
[From the northern mountains.]

00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,520
North Mountain.
Severní hora.
[North Mountain.]

00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,119
That will be forty.
To je za čtyřicet.
[That is forty.]

00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,879
Forty? No, ten.
Cože? Ne, deset.
[What? No, ten.]

00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,127
Oh, dear, that's no good.
Ne, to nepůjde.
[No, it's not.]

00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,159
See, this is from our winter stock,
Co udeřily ty mrazy,
[What struck you frosts,]

00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,159
where supply and demand have a big problem.
nabídka pokulhává za poptávkou.
[supply lagging behind demand.]

00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,362
You want to talk about a supply and demand problem?
Chcete mi vykládat o poptávce?
[Want to tell me about demand?]

00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,727
I sell ice for a living.
Já se živím prodejem ledu.
[I am a living by selling ice.]

00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,999
Ooh. That's a rough business to be in right now.
To teď není nejlepší obchod.
[This is not the best deal.]

00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,359
I mean, that is really...
Chci říct, že to je...
[I mean, it's...]

00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,721
That's unfortunate.
To je nepříjemné.
[That's annoying.]

00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,999
Still forty.
Čtyřicet.
[Forty.]

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,248
But I will throw in a visit to Oaken's sauna.
Ale přidám vám vstup do Oakenovy sauny.
[But add your entry to Oakenovy sauna.]

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,409
Hoo-hoo. Hi, family.
Ahoj, rodino.
[Hello, family.]

00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,086
Hoo-hoo!

00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,841
Ten's all I got. Help me out.
Mám jen deset. Mějte rozum.
[I have only ten. Grow up.]

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,801
Okay. Ten will get you this and no more.
Dobrá. Za deset dám jen tohle.
[All right. In ten I give you just that.]

00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,079
Okay, just tell me one thing.
Chci něco vědět.
[I want to know something.]

00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,039
What was happening on the North Mountain?
Co se děje na Severní hoře?
[What is happening in North Mount?]

00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,959
Did it seem magical?
Nějaká magie?
[Some kind of magic?]

00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,650
Yes!
Jo.
[Yeah.]

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,085
Now, back up while I deal with this crook, here.
A teď ustup. Vyřídím si to s tím lumpem.
[Now stand back. I will deal with this villain.]

00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,651
What did you call me?
Jak jsi mě to nazval?
[How did you call me?]

00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,410
Okay, okay. I'm out.
No jo!
[Oh yeah!]

00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,799
Whoa!

00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,286
Bye-bye.
Nashle!
[Bye!]

00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,441
No, Sven, I didn't get your carrots.
Ne, Svene, mrkve jsem nedostal.
[No, Sven, I got carrots.]

00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,364
But I did find us a place to sleep.
Ale našel jsem nám přespání.
[But I found us sleeping.]

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,570
And it's free.
A zadarmo.
[And free.]

00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,491
I'm sorry about this violence.
Za to násilí se omlouvám.
[For that I apologize violence.]

00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,250
I will add a quart of lutefisk,
Přidám vám pár slanečků
[I'll add you a few herring]

00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,091
so we have good feelings.
jako odškodnění.
[as compensation.]

00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,930
Just the outfit and the boots, yah?
Takže jen kožich a boty, ja?
[So a fur coat and boots, ja?]

00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,361
Uh...

00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,884
Reindeers are better than people
Sobi jsou lepší než lidi.
[Reindeer are better than people.]

00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,843
Sven, don't you think that's true?
Že, Svene, pravdu mám?
[That, Sven, I'm right?]

00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,239
"Yeah, people will beat you and curse you and cheat you"
Jo, lidi tě bijou a proklínaj', šidí.
[Yeah, they beat people and proklínaj' cheating.]

00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,841
"Every one of them's bad, except you!"
Tebe nemyslím, dyť tě znám!
[I do not think, Why, you know!]

00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,804
Aw. Thanks, buddy.
Díky, kámo.
[Thanks, buddy.]

00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,449
But people smell better than reindeers
Však lidi líp voní než sobi.
[However, people smell better than reindeer.]

00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,765
Sven, don't you think I'm right?
V tom, Svene, mám pravdu já!
[In fact, Sven, I'm right!]

00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,167
"That's once again true, for all except you!"
Jo, jenomže ty v tom výjimkou jsi!
[Yeah, but those in it except you!]

00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,479
You got me! Let's call it a night.
No teda! Tak snad dobrou noc!
[Whoops! So perhaps a good night!]

00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,409
"Good night"
'Brou noc!
[' Brou night!]

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,125

Pojď, když k nám sen spad',

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,845
Nice duet.
Pěkný duet.
[Nice duet.]

00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,926
It's just you. What do you want?
To jsi ty? Co tu chceš?
[It's you? What do you want?]

00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,562
I want you to take me up the North Mountain.
Chci, abys mě vzal na Severní horu.
[I want you to take me to the North Mountain.]

00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,490
I don't take people places.
Nikomu průvodce nedělám.
[Anyone doing guide.]

00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,759
Let me rephrase that.
Řeknu to tedy jinak.
[Therefore I say it differently.]

00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,405
Hey.
Hele!
[Hey!]

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,486
Take me up the North Mountain.
Vezmi mě na Severní horu.
[Take me to the North Mountain.]

00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,164
Please.
Prosím.
[Please.]

00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,362
Look, I know how to stop this winter.
Vím, jak zastavit tu zimu.

00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,330
We leave at dawn.
Vyrazíme za úsvitu.
[We'll leave at dawn.]

00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,922
And you forgot the carrots for Sven.
A zapomněla jsi mrkev pro Svena.
[And have you forgotten carrot for Sven.]

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,999
Oops, sorry.
Pardon.
[Sorry.]

00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,487
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't...
To jsem nechtěla.
[I did not want that.]

00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,207
We leave now. Right now.
Vyrazíme hned. Okamžitě.
[We leave now. Immediately.]

00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,486
Whew!

00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,399
Hang on! We like to go fast.
Drž se. Jezdíme rychle.
[Good luck. We go quickly.]

00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,919
I like fast. - Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Rychlost miluju.
[I love speed.]

00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,639
Get your feet down. This is fresh lacquer.
Ty nohy dolů. Jsou čerstvě natřené.
[Those legs down. They are freshly painted.]

00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,239
Seriously, were you raised in a barn?
Vyrostla jsi snad v lese?
[Perhaps you grew up in the woods?]

00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,679
Ugh!

00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,486
No, I was raised in a castle.
Ne, vyrostla jsem na zámku.
[No, I grew up in the castle.]

00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,405
So, uh, tell me,
Tak mi pověz,
[So tell me,]

00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,643
what made the queen go all ice-crazy?
proč začala královna tak mrazivě řádit?
[why the queen so chillingly rampage?]

00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,881
Oh. Well...
No...
[Well...]

00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,640
It was all my fault.
To byla moje chyba.
[It was my fault.]

00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,119
I got engaged, but then she freaked out,
Já se zasnoubila, což ji rozzlobilo,
[I got engaged, which made her angry]

00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,971
because I'd only just met him you know, that day.
protože jsem ho ten den zrovna potkala.
[because I had just met that day.]

00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,879
And she said she wouldn't bless the marriage, and...
Tak řekla, že našemu sňatku nepožehná.
[So she said our marriage bless.]

00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,439
Wait. You got engaged to someone you just met that day?
Počkat. Ty ses zasnoubila s někým, koho jsi znala sotva den?
[Wait. You're engaged to someone you barely knew the day?]

00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,759
Yeah. Anyway, I got mad, and so she got mad,
Jo. A pak jsem se naštvala a ona se taky naštvala,
[Yeah. And then I got mad and she was too upset,]

00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,879
and then she tried to walk away, and I grabbed her glove...
chtěla odejít a já jí stáhla rukavici...
[she wanted to leave and I pulled her glove...]

00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,039
Hang on!
Počkej.
[Wait.]

00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,999
You mean to tell me you got engaged
Chceš mi říct, že ses zasnoubila
[Are you telling me that you were engaged]

00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,679
to someone you just met that day?
s někým, koho jsi znala jen jeden den?
[with someone you knew just one day?]

00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,120
Yes. Pay attention.
Ano. Dávej pozor.
[Yes. Be careful.]

00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,199
But the thing is, she wore the gloves all the time,
Ona ty rukavice nosila už od malička,
[She wore those gloves since childhood,]

00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,639
so I just thought, maybe she has a thing about dirt.
tak jsem si říkala, že se třeba bojí špíny.
[I thought that perhaps afraid of dirt.]

00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,684
Didn't your parents ever warn you about strangers?
Rodiče tě nevarovali před cizími lidmi?
[Parents warn you in front of strangers?]

00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,169
Yyyyyes, they did.
Ano, varovali.
[Yes, they warned.]

00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,961
But Hans is not a stranger.
Ale Hans není cizí člověk.
[But Hans is not a stranger.]

00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,959
Oh, yeah? What's his last name?

Dělají to všichni chlapi.
[They do this all the guys.]

00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,559
Look, it doesn't matter. It's true love.
To je jedno. Je to má pravá láska.
[It does not matter. It is my true love.]

00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,220
It doesn't sound like true love.
Ta vypadá jinak.
[It looks different.]

00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,526
Are you some sort of love expert?
Jsi snad nějaký expert na lásku?
[You're probably an expert on love?]

No. But, uh, I have friends who are.

Stop talking. - No, no, no. No, no.
Buď zticha. - Ne, ne, ne.
[Shut up. - No no no.]

I'd like to meet these... - No, I mean it.
Moc ráda bych je potkala... - Myslím to vážně.
[I wish I met them... - I'm serious.]

Protože ti nevěřím.
[Because I believe it.]

00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,279

00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,851
Ow!

00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,119
Duck!
Uhni!
[Move!]

00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,759
You almost set me on fire!
Málem jsi mě zapálila!
[You almost got me lit!]

00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,961
But I didn't.
Ale nehoříš.
[But nehoříš.]

00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,759
Get ready to jump, Sven!
Připrav se na skok, Svene!
[Ready to jump, Sven!]

00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,279
You don't tell him what to do.
Ty mu nemáš co rozkazovat.
[They had got nothing to command.]

00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,845
I do!
Jen já!
[Just me!]

00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,879
Jump, Sven!
Skoč, Svene!
[Jump, Sven!]

00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,121
Phew!

00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,886
But I just paid it off.
Zrovna jsem je splatil.
[I just is repaid.]

00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,044
Uh-oh. No. No.
Ne. Ne!
[No. No!]

00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,519
No!
Ne!
[No!]

00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,399
Ah! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Ne, ne, ne...!
[No no no...!]

00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,681
Grab on!
Chyť se!
[Grab!]

00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,199
Pull, Sven. Pull!
Táhni, Svene. Táhni!
[Begone, Sven. Begone!]

00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,239
Whoa.

00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,688
I'll replace your sled, and everything in it.
Koupím ti nové sáně a vše, co v nich bylo.
[I'll buy you a new sled and everything in them.]

00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,281
And I understand if you don't want to help me anymore.
A pochopím, když už mi nebudeš chtít dál pomáhat.
[And I understand if you do not want to have me continue to help.]

00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,446
Of course I don't want to help her anymore. In fact,
Ovšemže už jí nechci pomáhat.
[Of course, now I do not want her help.]

00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,039
this whole thing has ruined me for helping anyone ever again.
A hlavně po téhle zkušenosti už nepomůžu nikdy nikomu.
[And especially after this experience I would never help anyone.]

00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,079
It's this way?
Jdu správně?
[I go right?]

00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,199
"She'll die on her own."
Ale ona sama umře.
[But she dies.]

00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,084
I can live with that. - Here we go.
S tím dokážu žít. - Tudy.
[I can live with. - This way.]

00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,319
"But you won't get your new sled if she's dead."
Když umře, tak nedostaneš nové sáně.
[When he dies, you get a new sled.]

00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,931
I think, actually, it's up.
Asi musím nahoru.
[I probably up.]

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,399
Sometimes, I really don't like you.
Někdy mě vážně štveš.
[Sometimes really annoy me.]

00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,921
Hold up! We're coming.
Počkej! Jdeme s tebou.
[Wait! We're going with you.]

00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,399
You are?
Vážně?
[Really?]

00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,559
I mean, sure. I'll let you tag along.
Jasně. Klidně se ke mně přidejte.
[Sure. Feel free to add me.]

00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,205
Arendelle.

00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,928
It's completely frozen.
Je úplně zmrzlý.
[It is completely frozen.]

00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,079
But it will be fine. Elsa will thaw it.
Zase roztaje. Elsa se uklidní.
[In turn melts. Elsa calm down.]

00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,439
Will she?
Vážně?
[Really?]

00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,119
Yeah. Now, come on.
Jo. Tak jdeme.
[Yeah. Let's go.]

00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,959
This way to the North Mountain?
Na Severní horu je to tudy?
[North Mountain's way?]

00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,599
More like this way.
Já bych řekl spíš tudy.
[I would say more that way.]

00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,162
I never knew winter could be so beautiful.
Netušila jsem, že zima může být tak překrásná.
[I did not know that winter can be so beautiful.]

00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,559
Yeah.
Jo.
[Yeah.]

00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,683
It really is beautiful, isn't it?
Je překrásná, že ano?
[It is beautiful, is not it?]

00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,361
But it's so white.
Ale moc bílá.
[But too much white.]

00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,610
You know, how about a little color?
Chtělo by to trochu barvy.
[It would take a bit of color.]

00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,999
I'm thinking maybe some crimson, chartreuse.
Napadá mě třeba karmínová nebo zelenkavá.
[I wonder perhaps crimson or greenish.]

00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,645
How about yellow?
A co třeba žlutá?
[And what about yellow?]

00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,963
No, not yellow. Yellow and snow?
Ne, žlutá ne. Žlutý sníh?
[No yellow Sun. Yellow snow?]

00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,479
No go.
Fujky.
[Fujky.]

00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,930
Am I right?
Nemám recht?
[I do not recht?]

00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,239
You're creepy.
Fujtajbl.
[Goo.]

00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,639
I don't want it.
Já to nechci.
[I do not want it.]

00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,079
Back at you. - Please don't drop me.
Nech si to. - Neupusťte mě.
[Keep it. - Do not drop me.]

00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,359
Come on, it's just a head.
Je to jen hlava.
[It's just a head.]

00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,679
All right. We got off to a bad start.
Asi jsme nezačali nejlíp.
[Maybe we did not start the best way.]

00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,086
Ew, ew, ew, the body!
Fuj, to tělo.
[Ugh, it's body.]

00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,799
Wait, what am I looking at right now?
Počkat, na co se to dívám?
[Wait, what am I looking at?]

00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,519
Why are you hanging off the earth like a bat?
Proč visíte jako netopýři?
[Why you hang like bats?]

00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,999
All right, wait one second.
Počkej, hned to napravím.
[Wait, I get it right.]

00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,531
Oh. Uh...

00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,759
Oh!

00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,325
Thank you. - You're welcome.
Děkuju. - Nemáš za co.
[Thank you. - You're welcome.]

00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,399
Now, I'm perfect.
Teď jsem dokonalý.
[Now I am perfect.]

00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,086
Well, almost.
Téměř.
[Almost.]

00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,159
It was like my whole life got turned upside down.
Jako by se mi celý život obrátil.
[As if my life turned around.]

00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,441
Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry!
To bylo moc. Promiň.
[That was too much. Sorry.]

00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,359
Head rush! - I was just... Are you okay?
To byla šlupka. - Jsi v pořádku?
[It was a shell. - Are you okay?]

00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,879
Are you kidding me? I am wonderful!
Děláš si švandu? Je mi báječně!
[Are you Švanda? It feels great!]

00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,730
I've always wanted a nose.
Vždycky jsem toužil po nosu.
[I always longed for a nose.]

00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,119
So cute.
Je tak mrňavý.
[It's so tiny.]

00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,879
It's like a little baby unicorn.
Jako růžek jednorožce.
[Like the corner of a unicorn.]

00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,999
But... Hey! Whoa!

00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,039
Oh.

00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,049
I love it even more.
Takhle se mi líbí ještě víc.
[That's how I like it even more.]

00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,085
All right, let's start this thing over.
Dobrá, začneme hezky znovu.
[Well, let's start again pretty.]

00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,239
Hi, everyone.
Ahoj vespolek.
[Hello, everyone.]

00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,319
I'm Olaf.
Já jsem Olaf.
[I Olaf.]

00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,726
And I like warm hugs.
Mám rád vřelá objetí.
[I like a warm embrace.]

00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,281
Olaf?

00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,409
That's right. Olaf.
No ano. Olaf.
[Well, yes. Olaf.]

00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,608
And you are?
A ty jsi...
[And you...]

00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,081
Oh. Um...

00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,239
I'm Anna.
Já jsem Anna.
[I'm Anna.]

00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,679
And who's the funky-looking donkey over there?
Kdo je ten srandovní osel, co s tebou jde?
[Who's the funny donkey, what are you doing?]

00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,239
That's Sven.
To je Sven.
[This is Sven.]

00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,199
And who's the reindeer?
A kdo je ten sob?
[And who is this method?]

00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,239
Sven.

00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,079
Oh, they're... Oh. Okay. That makes things easier for me.
Bezva. Líp si je zapamatuju.
[Cool. Better get them to remember.]

00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,760
Aw, look at him trying to kiss my nose.
Chce mi dát pusu na nos.
[He wants to give me a kiss on the nose.]

00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,883
I like you, too.
Taky se mi líbíš.
[Also, I like you.]

00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,522
Olaf. Did Elsa build you? - Yeah. Why?
Olafe. Tebe postavila Elsa? - Jo. Proč?
[Olaf. He puts Elsa? - Yeah. Why?]

00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,759
Do you know where she is? - Yeah. Why?
A víš, kde je? - Jo. Proč?
[And you know where he is? - Yeah. Why?]

00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,919
Fascinating.

00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,681
Do you think you could show us the way? - Yeah. Why?
Mohl bys nás k ní zavést? - Jo. Proč?
[Could you introduce us to her? - Yeah. Why?]

00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,119
How does this work? Ow!
Jak to asi funguje?
[How about work?]

00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,359
Stop it, Sven. Trying to focus, here.
Přestaň, Svene. Snažíme se soustředit.
[Stop, Sven. We're trying to concentrate.]

00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,562
Yeah. Why? - I'll tell you why.
Jo. Proč? - Řeknu ti proč.
[Yeah. Why? - I'll tell you why.]

00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,645
We need Elsa to bring back summer.
Aby přivolala zpátky léto.
[Back to summon the summer.]

00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,519
Summer?
Léto?
[Summer?]

00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,839
Oh. I don't know why,
Ani nevím proč,
[I do not know why,]

00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,599
but I've always loved the idea of summer
ale léto mě vždycky nesmírně přitahovalo.
[But the summer was always very attracted.]

00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,199
and sun, and all things hot.
A slunce a pěkný hic.
[And the sun and the pretty hic.]

00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,279
Really?
Vážně?
[Really?]

00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,839
I'm guessing you don't have much experience with heat.
Koukám, že s horkem moc zkušeností nemáš.
[I guess the heat you do not have much experience.]

00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,121
Nope.
Ne.
[No.]

00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,759
But sometimes I like to close my eyes,
Ale někdy zavřu oči
[But sometimes I close my eyes]

00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,806
and imagine what it would be like when summer does come.
a představuju si, jaké by to bylo, kdyby k nám přišlo léto.
[and imagine what it would be like if the summer has come to us.]

00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:50,119
Bees will buzz, kids will blow dandelion fuzz
Chmýříčko na nebe láká sluníčko,
[Chmýříčko the sky attracts sun]

00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:55,087
And I'll be doing whatever snow does in summer
a já zas udělám to, co sníh dělá v létě!
[and I again do what it does snow in summer!]

00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,839
A drink in my hand
Jen drink objednám,
[Just order a drink,]

00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,239
My snow up against the burning sand
hned šlofíka v horkém písku dám,
[just nap in the hot sand give,]

00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,519
Probably getting gorgeously tanned
než se zvednu, s naháči zhnědnu
[before I pick up with bathers Brown]

00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,290
In summer.
v létě!
[in summer!]

00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,879
I'll finally see a summer breeze
Snad uvidím, kam vánice
[Perhaps see where blizzard]

00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,999
Blow away a winter storm
se v tom parnu poděje,
[In the heat of the soil]

00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,279
And find out what happens to solid water
a zjistím, jak ledu tu úsměv tuhne,
[and see how the smile of ice conditions,]

00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,211
When it gets warm
když v teple je!
[when it is warm!]

00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,999
And I can't wait to see
Těším se, už teď vím,
[I'm looking forward, now I know,]

00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,043
What my buddies all think of me
jak své přátele překvapím,
[how to surprise your friends,]

00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,799
Just imagine how much cooler I'll be
všechna srdce pro mne roztají hned
[all hearts melt for me now]

00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,207
In summer!
v tom létě!
[in the summer!]

00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,679
The hot and the cold are both so intense
Je chvilenku horko, zima je pak,
[Chvilenku is hot, then cold,]

00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,247
Put them together It just makes sense
kdyby šly spojit, všem vytřu zrak!
[if he went unite all wipe sight!]

00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,679
Winter's a good time to stay in and cuddle
V zimě chci doma být, hezky to klouže,
[In winter, I want to be at home, pretty slippery,]

00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,223
But put me in summer and I'll be a...
však jen vlítnu do léta, je ze mě...
[But just vlítnu the summer, it is me...]

00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,520
{\an8}(puddle?)
(louže?)
[(puddle?)]

00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,599
Happy snowman!
...šťastný sněhulák!
[... happy snowman!]

00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,879
When life gets rough
Když na draka je život,
[When the dragon's life]

00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,401
I like to hold on to my dream
denně tajně sním,
[daily secretly dream]

00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:55,407
Of relaxing in the summer sun, just letting off steam
jak mi léto zvedne náladu a páru upustím!
[how my summer lifts the mood and the pair will drop!]

00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,285
Oh, the sky will be blue
Nebe znám z modrých snů,
[I know the sky blue dream]

00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,724
And you guys will be there, too
tak přijeďte, budu tu.
[then come, I'll be there.]

00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,679
When I finally do
Budu dělat jen to,
[I will do just that,]

00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:09,168
What frozen things do in summer!
co dělává sníh vždy v létě!
[What delave always snow in summer!]

00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:10,884
I'm gonna tell him.
Já mu to řeknu.
[I'll tell him.]

00:49:10,885 --> 00:49:11,884
Don't you dare.
Opovaž se.
[Dare you.]

00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,687
In summer!
Vždy v létě!
[Always in the summer!]

00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,559
So, come on! Elsa's this way.
Tak pojďte. K Else je to tudy.
[Come on. The Else's way.]

00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,759
Let's go bring back summer!
Přivoláme léto zpátky!
[We summon the summer back!]

00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,200
I'm coming!
Už běžím.
[I'm coming.]

00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,525
Somebody's gotta tell him.
Někdo mu to musí říct.
[Someone needs to tell him.]

00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,039
No, no. You've got the bark facing down.
Ne. Dáváš to kůrou dolů.
[No. You give it zest down.]

00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,765
The bark needs to be face-up.
Kůra musí být nahoru.
[The bark must be up.]

00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,239
Bark down is drier. - Bark up!
Dolů to líp vyschne.
[It dries down better.]

00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,279
Bark down! - Papa!
Nahoru! - Dolů!
[Up! - Down!]

00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,999
Cloak? Does anyone need a cloak?

Why isn't she knocking?
Proč nezaklepe?
[Why knocks?]

00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,165
Do you think she knows how to knock?
Ona neumí klepat?

Remember that?
Nevzpomínáš?
[You remember?]

00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,647
And you're alive?
A ty žiješ?
[And you live?]

Ano.
[Yes.]

00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,449
Elsa, we were so close.
Elso, bývaly jsme si blízké.
[Elso, we used to be close.]

00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,524
We can be like that again.
Nemůžeme to vrátit?

[We can not. Goodbye, Anna.]

00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,559
Elsa, wait.
Elso, počkej.
[Elso, wait.]

00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,759
No, I'm just trying to protect you.
Ne, jen se tě snažím ochránit.
[No, I'm trying to protect.]

00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,611
You don't have to protect me. I'm not afraid.
Mě nemusíš chránit, já se nebojím.
[You do not have to defend, I'm afraid.]

Please don't shut me out again.
Prosím, nebuď ke mně tak chladná.
[Please do not be so cold to me.]

Please don't slam the door
Nezamykej se!
[Do not lock it!]

00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:54,599
You don't have to keep your distance anymore
Když si přestáváme věřit, je to zlé.
[When you stop believing, it is bad.]

00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,610
'Cause for the first time in forever
Věř mi, že právě teď jak nikdy
[Believe me, now as ever]

For the first time in forever
věř mi, právě teď jak nikdy

[the truth can nevylhat.]

00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,608
We can head down this mountain together.
Spolu odejdem z téhleté hory,
[Together we will from this mountain,]

00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:09,639
You don't have to live in fear
strach tě cestou opustí.
[Fear leaves you the way.]

00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:13,561
'Cause for the first time in forever
Vždyť přece právě teď tak šťastná
[After all, now so happy]

00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:16,919
I will be right here
budu tam, kde jsi.
[I'll be right where you are.]

00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,199
{\an8}Anna.
Anno.
[Anno.]

00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,119
{\an8}Please go back home
Běž domů, běž,
[Go home, go,]

00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,890
{\an8}Your life awaits
svůj život měj.
[Have your life.]

00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,239
{\an8}Go enjoy the sun, and open up the gates
Užívej si slunce, brány otvírej.
[Enjoy the sun, open the gates.]

00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,350
Yeah, but...
Ano, ale...
[Yes but...]

00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:27,719
{\an8}I know.
Já vím...
[I know...]

00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:32,050
{\an8}You mean well, but leave me be
Jak hodná jsi. Však musíš jít,
[How good you are. But you gotta go,]

00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,559
{\an8}Yes, I'm alone
chci takhle žít
[I want to live like this]

00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,519
{\an8}But I'm alone and free
a věčně volná být.
[and be forever free.]

00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:41,282
{\an8}Just stay away and you'll be safe from me
Jen straň se mě a budeš v bezpečí.
[Just turn away from me and you'll be safe.]

00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,521
Actually, we're not
Ne, to nejsme, ne!
[No, we're not, do not!]

00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:44,950
{\an8}What do you mean, you're not?
Řekni mi, proč ne!
[Tell me, why not!]

00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,450
I get the feeling you don't know
Podivné věci dějí se!
[Strange things are happening!]

00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,681
{\an8}What do I not know?
Týkají se mě?
[They relate to me?]

00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,399
Arendelle's in deep, deep, deep
Arendelle nám přikryl sníh,
[Arendelle we covered snow]

00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,682
deep snow
sníh s tmou.
[snow and darkness.]

00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,041
{\an8}What?
Cože?
[What?]

00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:59,002
You kind of set off an eternal winter everywhere.
Tak nějak jsi rozpoutala nekonečnou zimu úplně všude.
[So somehow you unleash an endless winter everywhere.]

00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,359
{\an8}Everywhere?
Jak všude?
[As everywhere?]

00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,279
Well, it's okay, you can just unfreeze it.
Ale to nic, stačí spustit tání.
[But it's nothing, just start melting.]

00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,528
{\an8}No, I can't. I don't know how.
To nejde, já nevím jak.
[You can not, I do not know how.]

00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,081
Sure you can. I know you can.
Jasně že víš. Vím to, že víš.
[Sure, you know. I know that you know.]

00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:12,401
'Cause for the first time in forever
Protože právě teď jak nikdy...
[Because right now as ever...]

00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:15,519
{\an8}Oh, I'm such a fool! I can't be free!
Když volnost práh svůj překročí...
[When freedom exceeds its threshold...]

00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:17,950
You don't have to be afraid
je už zbytečné se bát!
[it is unnecessary to worry!]

00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,839
{\an8}No escape from the storm inside of me
bouře v mém nitru na svět útočí!
[storm inside of me attacking the world!]

00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:21,839
We can work this out together
Útok nejprudší, ten zvládnem!
[Sharpest attack, he'll manage!]

00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,819
{\an8}I can't control the curse!
Jsem na dně s vůlí svou!
[I'm down to play her!]

00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,639
We'll reverse the storm you've made
Utišíme bouři tvou.
[Beating your storm.]

00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:29,219
{\an8}Anna, please you'll only make it worse!
Anno, nech mě být, jen zhoršíš to!
[Anna, let me be, just making things worse it!]

00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,019
Don't panic!
Proč křičíš?
[Why are you screaming?]

00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:31,319
{\an8}There's so much fear!
Měj ze mě strach!
[Have afraid of me!]

00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:33,919
We'll make the sun shine bright
Vzbuď slunce na střechách!
[Wake up the sun on the roof!]

00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:35,319
{\an8}You're not safe here!
Běž rychle pryč!
[Go away quickly!]

00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:37,119
We can face this thing together
Správný klíč najdeme spolu!
[Together we can find the right key!]

00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:38,119
{\an8}No!
Ne...!
[No...!]

00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,279
We can change this winter weather
Zahnat můžem krutou zimu,
[We can fight off the bitter cold,]

00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,768
And everything will be all right
když pomůžem si ty a já.
[Helping you and me.]

00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,761
{\an8}I can't!
Já... já... ne...!
[I... I... do not...!]

00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,441
Anna!
Anno!
[Anna!]

00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,201
Are you okay?
Jsi v pořádku?
[Are you okay?]

00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,479
I'm okay.
Nic mi není.
[It's nothing.]

00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,920
I'm fine.
Jsem v pořádku.
[I'm fine.]

00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,159
Who's this?
Kdo to je?
[Who is it?]

00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,771
Wait, it doesn't matter. Just...
Na tom nesejde.
[It does not matter.]

00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,199
You have to go.
Musíte odejít.
[You have to leave.]

00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,999
No, I know we can figure this out together.
Ne. Já vím, že společně to vyřešíme.
[No. I know that together we will solve it.]

00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,079
How?
Jak?
[How?]

00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,442
What power do you have to stop this winter?
Jakými kouzly vládneš, abys vše změnila?
[Curses you control to change everything?]

00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,046
To stop me?
A hlavně mě?
[And most importantly to me?]

00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,559
Anna, I think we should go.
Anno, měli bychom jít.
[Anna, we should go.]

00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,559
No, I'm not leaving without you, Elsa.
Ne, já bez tebe neodejdu, Elso.
[No, I'm not leaving without you, Elsa.]

00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,444
Yes, you are.
Ano. Odejdeš.
[Yes. Leave.]

00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,799
Stop! Put us down!
Stůj! Nech nás být!
[Stop! Leave us alone!]

00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,604
Go away.
Jít pryč.
[Go away.]

00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,565
Heads up!
Bacha na hlavu!
[Watch the head!]

00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,439
Watch out for my butt!
A teď na zadek!
[Now butt!]

00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,959
It is not nice to throw people!
Já ti dám, házet po nás sněhuláky.
[I'll give you throw at us snowmen.]

00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,199
Whoa, whoa, whoa, feisty-pants. Okay, relax.
Kroť se, jenom klid.
[Kroto is just calm.]

00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,599
Just calm down! Calm down! - Okay! All right!
Uklidni se! - Dobře!
[Calm down! - Alright!]

00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,279
I'm okay. - Just let the snowman be.
Už jsem v klidu. - Nech tu obludu být.
[I'm calm. - Let there be a monster.]

00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,599
I'm calm.
Jsem klidná. - Prima.
[I am calm. - Prima.]

00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,325
Oh! Come on!
No tak!
[Come on!]

00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,839
Oh. Look, see? Now you made him mad.
Vidíš, teď jsi ho rozdráždila.
[See, now you see him rozdráždila.]

00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,804
I'll distract him. You guys go.
Odlákám ho. Vy utečte.
[Distract him. You run away.]

00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,331
No, no! Not you guys!
Ne. Vy zůstaňte.
[No. You stay.]

00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,480
This just got a whole lot harder.
Bez nohou to bude těžší.
[Without legs it will be harder.]

00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,321
Look out!
Bacha!
[Bach!]

00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,763
What are you doing?
Co to děláš?
[What are you doing?]

00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,441
I got him!
Dostala jsem ho!
[I got it!]

00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,159
Whoa! Stop!
Stůj!
[Stop!]

00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,407
It's a hundred-foot drop.
Je to nejmíň třicet metrů.
[It is the least thirty meters.]

00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,007
It's two hundred.
Je to šedesát.
[It's sixty.]

00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,521
Ow!

00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,199
What's that for? - I'm digging a snow anchor.
Co to děláš? - Kopu sněhovou kotvu.
[What are you doing? - Digging a snow anchor.]

00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,890
Okay. What if we fall?
Dobře. A když spadneme?
[Okay. And when you fall?]

00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,119
There's 20 feet of fresh powder down there.
Dole je šest metrů prašanu.
[Below is six meters of powder.]

00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,879
It'll be like landing on a pillow.
Bude to jako spadnout do peřin.
[It'll be like falling into the bed.]

00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:42,959
Hopefully.
Doufejme.
[Hopefully.]

00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,199
Okay, Anna. On three.
Drž se, Anno. Na tři.
[Hold on, Anna. Three.]

00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,559
One...
Raz.
[Raz.]

00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:50,639
Okay. You tell me when. I'm ready to go.
Stačí říct kdy, jsem připravená.
[Suffice to say when I'm ready.]

00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,279
Two... - I was born ready! Yes!
Dva. - Od narození.
[Two. - From birth.]

00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,561
Calm down.
Uklidni se.
[Calm down.]

00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,679
Tree!
Tři!
[Three!]

00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,961
What the... Whoa!
Co to...
[What the...]

00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,604
That happened.
To byl úlet.
[It was a fling.]

01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,519
Man, am I out of shape.
Jsem nějak z formy.
[I kind of mold.]

01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,519
There we go. Hey, Anna!
A je to. Anno!
[And it's done. Anna!]

01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,359
Sven! Where did you guys go?
Svene! Kam jste se poděli?
[Sven! Where did you go?]

01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,211
We totally lost Marshmallow back there.
Ten Máršmeloun už je v čudu.
[He Máršmeloun already in čudu.]

01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,039
Hey! We were just talking about you.
Zrovna jsme o tobě mluvili.
[We were just talking about you.]

01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,208
All good things, all good things.
Jen v dobrém. Jen v dobrém.
[Just for good. Just for good.]

01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:23,721
No!
Ne!
[No!]

01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,199
This is not making much of a difference, is it?
Nějak výrazně tě to nezpomaluje, že ne?
[Somehow it does not slow down considerably you, do you?]

01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,799
Olaf!
Olafe!
[Olaf!]

01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,764
Hang in there, guys!
Držte se, vy dva!
[Hold on, you two!]

01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:35,959
Go. Go faster!
Lez rychleji.
[Lez faster.]

01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,810
Wait, what?
Počkej. Co je?
[Wait. What is?]

01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,599
Ow!

01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,079
Kristoff!
Kristoffe!
[Kristoff!]

01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,808
Don't come back!
Nevracet se!
[Never to return!]

01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,521
We won't.
Jasně.
[Sure.]

01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,484
Hey, you were right. Just like a pillow.
Měl jsi pravdu. Jako do peřin.
[You were right. As duvets.]

01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:04,886
Olaf!
Olafe.
[Olaf.]

01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,999
I can't feel my legs! I can't feel my legs!
Necítím nohy. Já necítím nohy!
[I feel my legs. I feel my legs!]

01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,559
Those are my legs.
To jsou moje nohy.
[These are my legs.]

01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,079
Oooh. Hey, do me a favor, grab my butt.
Buď tak hodný a podej mi zadek.
[Be so kind and give me your ass.]

01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,169
Oh. That feels better.
To je lepší.
[It is better.]

01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,921
Hey, Sven! He found us.
Ahoj, Svene. On nás našel.
[Hi, Sven. He found us.]

01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,159
Who's my cute little reindeer?
Kdo je můj roztomilý sobík?
[Who is my cute Sobík?]

01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,279
Don't talk to him like that.
Takhle mi na něj nemluv.
[I like to talk to him.]

01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,164
You're tickling me.
To šimralo.
[That tickling.]

01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,281
Here.
Pojď.
[Come on.]

01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:27,599
Whoa!

01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,799
Are you okay?
Jsi celá?
[You all right?]

01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,365
Thank you.
Díky.
[Thanks.]

01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,526
How's your head? - Ah! Ooh!
Co tvoje hlava?
[What about your head?]

01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,439
It's fine. Uh...
V pohodě.
[Cool.]

01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,119
Uh, I'm good. I've got a thick skull.
Nic mi není, mám tvrdou lebku.
[I'm fine, I have a hard skull.]

01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:39,129
I don't have a skull.
Já žádnou nemám.
[I do not have one.]

01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:40,921
Or bones.
Ani kosti.
[Nor bones.]

01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,641
So, uh... So, now what?
Takže... Co bude teď?
[So... what happens now?]

01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,799
Now what?
Co teď?
[What now?]

01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,199
Now what?
Co teď?
[What now?]

01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,481
Oh...

01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,040
What am I gonna do?
Co si teď počnu?
[What are you going?]

01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,839
She threw me out.
Vyhodila mě.
[She threw me.]

01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,199
I can't go back to Arendelle with the weather like this.
S nepořízenou se nemůžu do Arendellu vrátit.
[I can not get nothing in return Arendellu.]

01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,279
And then there's your ice business.
A co bude s tvým ledařstvím?
[And what about your ledařstvím?]

01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,006
Hey, hey. Don't worry about my ice business.
S mým ledařstvím si starost nedělej.
[With my ledařstvím not worry.]

01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,259
Worry about your hair!
Spíš se svými vlasy.
[Rather, with his hair.]

01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:02,639
What? I just fell off a cliff. You should see your hair.
Cože? Spadla jsem z útesu. Podívej se na svoje.
[What? I fell off a cliff. Look at her.]

01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,359
No, yours is turning white.
Ne, tvoje vlasy bělají.
[No, your hair whiten.]

01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:07,279
White? It's... What?
Bělají? Cože?
[BELA? What?]

01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,482
It's because she struck you, isn't it?
To proto, že tě trefila, že ano?
[That's because you hit, right?]

01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,690
Does it look bad?
Vypadá to špatně?
[It looks bad?]

01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,039
No. - You hesitated.
Ne. - Zaváhal jsi.
[No. - You hesitated.]

01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,287
No, I didn't.
Ne, nezaváhal.
[No, he did not hesitate.]

01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,559
Anna, you need help, okay? Come on.
Anno, potřebuješ pomoc, pojď se mnou.
[Anna, you need help, come with me.]

01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,250
Okay! Where are we going?
Tak jo. Kam jdeme?
[So yeah. Where are we going?]

01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,359
To see my friends.
Za mými přáteli.
[For my friends.]

01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,679
The love experts?
Za experty na lásku?
[For experts on love?]

01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,530
Love experts?
Experti na lásku?
[Experts in love?]

01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,159
And don't worry, they'll be able to fix this.
Neboj se, oni tě z toho dostanou.
[Do not worry, they'll get out of it.]

01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,010
How do you know?
Jak to víš?
[How do you know?]

01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,723
Because I've seen them do it before.
Protože jsem viděl, jak to udělali kdysi.
[Because I saw how they did it once.]

01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,159
I like to consider myself a love expert.
Já jsem podle mě taky expert na lásku.
[I think I'm also an expert on love.]

01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,570
Get it together.
Koukej se sebrat.
[Look to pick up.]

01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,559
Control it.
Ovládej to.
[Take control of it.]

01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,364
Don't feel. Don't feel.
Skrývej city. Skrývej city.
[Of hiding emotions. Of hiding emotions.]

01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,490
Don't feel.
Skrývej city.
[Of hiding emotions.]

01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:48,324
Don't feel!
Skrývej city!
[Of hiding feelings!]

01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,407
Look, Sven, the sky's awake.
Hele, Svene. Obloha je vzhůru.
[Hey, Sven. The sky is awake.]

01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,569
Are you cold? - A little.
Je ti zima? - Trochu.
[Are you cold? - A little.]

01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,959
Uh... Wait. Come here.
Počkej, pojď sem.
[Wait, come here.]

01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,241
Huh?

01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,251
Ooh.

01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,919
So, uh, about my friends. Well...
Víš... K těm mým přátelům...
[You know... To those of my friends...]

01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,359
I say "friends"...
Říkám přátelé,
[I tell my friends,]

01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,399
They're more like family.
ale je to spíš moje rodina.
[But it's more my family.]

01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,399
Anyway, when I was a kid, it was just me and Sven.
Jako kluk jsem měl jen Svena,
[As a boy I had only Sven,]

01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,489
Until they, you know, kinda took us in.
a tak mě přijali mezi sebe.
[so they accepted him.]

01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,365
They did?
Opravdu?
[Really?]

01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:34,679
Yeah. I don't want to scare you.
Jo. Nerad bych tě vyděsil,
[Yeah. I would hate to scare you,]

01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:39,119
They can be a little inappropriate and loud.
ale někdy se chovají nevhodně a křičí.
[But sometimes they behave inappropriately and screaming.]

01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,685
Very loud.
Spíš řvou.
[Rather scream.]

01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,679
They are also stubborn at times,
Někdy jsou tvrdohlaví
[Sometimes they are stubborn]

01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:43,959
and a little overbearing.
a někdy nesnesitelní.
[and sometimes unbearable.]

01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,759
And heavy. Really, really, heavy.
A těžcí, hodně, hodně těžcí,
[A heavy, very, very heavy,]

01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,119
But you'll get it. They mean well.
což všechno uvidíš. Ale myslí to dobře.
[all of which you'll see. But he means well.]

01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,448
Kristoff, they sound wonderful.
Kristoffe, určitě jsou báječní.
[Kristoff, it's wonderful.]

01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:54,971
Okay, then.
Tak dobře.
[Well.]

01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,489
Meet my family.
Tohle je moje rodina.
[This is my family.]

01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,401
Hey, guys.
Nazdar.
[Hello.]

01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,450
They're rocks.
Jsou to kameny.
[They are stones.]

01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,799
You are a sight for sore eyes.
Moc rád vás zase vidím.
[Very glad to see you again.]

01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,731
He's crazy. - Hey look, ???'s back from vacation!
On se zbláznil.
[He was crazy.]

01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,488
Rocko's looking sharp, as usual.
Šutr vypadá drsně, jako obvykle.
[Rock looks tough, as usual.]

01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,919
Clay, whoa... I don't even recognize you.
Balvane, málem bych tě nepoznal.
[Boulder, I almost did not recognize you.]

01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,039
You lost so much weight.
Hodně jsi shodil.
[You dropped a lot.]

01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,999
I'll distract him while you run.
Zabavím ho a ty uteč.
[I confiscate it and you run.]

01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,123
Hi, Sven's family!
Ahoj, Svenova rodino.
[Hi, Svenova family.]

01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,801
It's nice to meet you.
Moc rád vás poznávám.
[Very glad to meet you.]

01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,439
Because I love you, Anna, I insist you run.
Mám tě rád, Anno, a trvám na tom, abys utekla.
[I love you, Anna, and I insist that you ran.]

01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:27,531
I understand you're love experts. Ooh!
Slyšel jsem, že jste experti na lásku.
[I heard you're an expert on love.]

01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,490
Why aren't you running?
Proč neutíkáš?
[Why neutíkáš?]

01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:30,799
Uh...

01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,287
Okay. Well, I'm gonna go.
Tak fajn. Já už budu muset...
[OK. I already I have to...]

01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,444
No, no, no. Anna, wait.
Ne, Anno, stůj.
[No, Anna, stop.]

01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,490
Kristoff!
Kristoffe?
[Kristoff?]

01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,444
Whoa!

01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,166
Hey!
Ahoj!
[Hello!]

01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,559
Kristoff's home!
Kristoff je doma!
[Kristoff is home!]

01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:49,839
Kristoff's here! Kristoff's home!
Kristoff je tady!
Kristoff je tady!

01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,319
Wait, "Kristoff"?
Moment. Kristoff?
[Moment. Kristoff?]

01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,799
Ah, let me look at you.
Ukaž se mi.
[Show me.]

01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,479
Take off your clothes, I wash them.
Sundej si šaty, vyperu je.
[Take off your clothes, wash them.]

01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,364
No! No, I'm going to keep my clothes on.
Ne, já si šaty sundávat nebudu.
[No, I will not take off his clothes.]

01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:58,799
Look, it's great to see you all,
Moc rád vás vidím,
[Very glad to see you,]

01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,039
but where's Granpabbie?
ale kde je Pratroll?
[but where Pratroll?]

01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:01,159
He's napping.
Podřimuje.
[Napping.]

01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,959
But look, I grew a mushroom.
Koukej, narostla mi houba.
[Look, I grew fungus.]

01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,559
I earned my fire crystal.
Já dostala ohnivý krystal.
[I got a fiery crystal.]

01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,000
I passed a kidney stone.
A já ledvinové kameny.
[And I kidney stones.]

01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,319
Kristoff, pick me up.
Kristoffe, zvedni mě.
[Kristoff, pick me.]

01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,599
You're getting big.
Ty jsi vyrostl!
[You're a grown up!]

01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,881
Good for you.
Gratuluju.
[Congratulations.]

01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,568
Trolls. They're trolls!
Trollové! Jsou to trollové!
[Trolls! These are the trolls!]

01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,124
He's brought a girl!
Přivedl si holku!
[He brought a girl!]

01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,886
A girl!
Holku!
[Girl!]

01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,759
Is that a real girl?

01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,879
She's like a little cupcake.
Ta je ale hezká.
[But that is pretty.]

01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:23,959
What's going on?
Co se to děje?
[What's going on?]

01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,286
I've learned to just roll with it.
Zkus si toho nevšímat.
[Try to ignore.]

01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,879
Let me see. Bright eyes, working nose,
Tak se ukaž. Jasný oči, čistej nos,
[So show. Bright eyes, nose clean,]

01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,411
strong teeth!
silný zuby.
[strong teeth.]

01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:32,279
Yes, yes. She'll do nicely for our Kristoff.
Nevybral sis vůbec špatně, Kristoffe.
[You did not choose bad at all, Kristoff.]

01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:33,519
Wait, wait, wait. Oh, um, no.
Počkat. Ne.
[Wait. No.]

01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,919
You've got the wrong idea.
Špatně si to vykládáte.
[Wrongly telling it.]

01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:36,079
No. That's not why I brought her here.
Proto jsem ji nepřivedl.
[That's why I did not bring it.]

01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,959
Right. We're not... I'm not...
Správně. My nejsme... Já nejsem...
[Right. We're not... I'm not...]

01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,159
What's the issue, dear?
V čem je problém, drahá?
[What's the problem, dear?]

01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:43,319
Why are you holding back from such a man?
Tobě nevyhovuje takový chlap?
[You, does not such a man?]

01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,329
Is it the clumpy way he walks?
Snad proto, že tak divně jde?
[Perhaps because so strange is going on?]

01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:47,679
What? - Or the grumpy way he talks?
Cože? - Občas mluví ošklivě?
[What? - Sometimes speaks badly?]

01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,479
Or the pear-shaped, square-shaped
Po kom nohy rostlé
[After whom proportioned legs]

01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,039
Weirdness of his feet?
do "ó" může mít?
[to" O" can have?]

01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:52,159
Hey!
Hej!
[Hey!]

01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,119
And though we know he washes well
A přesto, že se umejvá,
[And though umejvá,]

01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,759
He always ends up sort of smelly
řek' bych, že smrádne, a ne vábně.
[I should say that smrádne and not tempting.]

01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,399
But you'll never meet a fella
Že má kouska citu v těle,
[It has a shred of emotion in your body,]

01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,359
Who's as sensitive and sweet
může úsměv prozradit!
[may reveal a smile!]

01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,479
That's nice, but...
To je hezké, ale...
[That's nice, but...]

01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:03,519
So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper
l jako prima chlap má svý mouchy,
[l as a nice guy has his flies,]

01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,599
So, he's got a few flaws
něco zásadních vad!
[something fundamental defects!]

01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:06,839
Like his peculiar brain, dear
Dva stejný mozky pro oba,
[Two brains the same for both,]

01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:07,999
His thing with the reindeer
pro přítele soba.
[Friend for the reindeer.]

01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,679
That's a little outside of nature's laws
Což je přírodní úkaz na kvadrát!
[Which is a natural phenomenon in the square!]

01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:10,799
This is not about me!
Tady nejde o mě.
[This is not about me.]

01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,559
So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper
I jako prima chlap má svý mouchy,
[I like nice guy has his flies,]

01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,759
But this we're certain of
však přesto věříme,
[Nevertheless, we believe,]

01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:17,399
You can fix this fixer-upper up
že z much pilný včelky uděláš,
[that much of industrious bees do,]

01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,199
With a little bit of love
jen tvou lásečku to chce!
[Only your lásečku wants it!]

01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,239
Can we please just stop talking about this?
Mohli bychom prosím změnit téma?
[Could we please change the subject?]

01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,479
We've got a real, actual problem, here.
Máme totiž jeden skutečný problém.
[Because we have a real problem.]

01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:26,081
I'll say. So, tell me, dear...
Možná pak. Ale teď mi pověz...
[Maybe then. But now tell me...]

01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,359
Is it the way that he runs scared?
Tak možná že je zbabělec?
[So maybe that's a coward?]

01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,449
Or that he's socially impaired?
A lidi pro něj jsou jen věc!
[A People for him are just the thing!]

01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,879
Or that he only likes to tinkle in the woods?
A taky chodívá rád čurat do lesa!
[And chodívá like to pee in the woods!]

01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:34,999
I did not need to know that.
To jsem vědět nemusela.
[I did not know.]

01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,239
Are you holding back your fondness
Řekni, co tě trápí - no tak!
[Tell me what's bothering you - come on!]

01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,719
Due to his unmanly blondness?
Že je hezounek a blonďák?
[That's a pretty boy and blond?]

01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:43,403
Or the way he covers up that he's the honest goods?
Nebo to, že dobrák je, a přesto žije sám?
[Or that it is a good man, and yet he lives alone?]

01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,519
He's just a bit of a fixer-upper
I jako prima chlap má svý mouchy,
[I like nice guy has his flies,]

01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,039
He's got a couple of bugs
i v kaši několik much.
[even in the mash some flies.]

01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:50,919
(No, I don't!) - His isolation is confirmation
(Ne, nemám!) - Že sám je věčně, je nebezpečné,
[(No, I do not!) - That alone is eternal, it is dangerous,]

01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:53,919
Of his desperation for healing hugs
v noci chladné chřadne, je pro svět vzduch!
[at night the cold wither, is the world's air!]

01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,479
So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper
I jako prima chlap má svý mouchy,
[I like nice guy has his flies,]

01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,239
But we know what to do
tak poslyš nápad náš:
[listen to our idea:]

01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,279
The way to fix up this fixer-upper
my mouchy tvé s jeho sezdáme,
[We fly thy with his sezdáme,]

01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,839
Is to fix him up with you
ať chlapa bez chybičky máš!
[whether you're a guy flawlessly!]

01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,519
Whoa!

01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,165
Stop it, stop it, stop it! Enough!
Přestaň, přestaň. Tak dost!
[Stop it, stop it. Enough!]

01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:08,366
She is engaged to someone else, okay?
Je zasnoubená s někým jiným, jasné?
[Is engaged to someone else, right?]

01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,079
So, she's a bit of a fixer-upper
I prima slečinka má svý mouchy.
[I miss having my prima flies.]

01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,009
That's a minor thing
Jasně, to bych řek'!
[Yeah, I'd say'!]

01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,479
Her quote "engagement" is a flex arrangement
To zasnoubení přece nemoc není!
[This engagement does not a disease!]

01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,839
And by the way, I don't see no ring
Dyť heleďte - nemá prstýnek!
[Why, look here - does not ring!]

01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:23,119
So, she's a bit of a fixer-upper
I prima slečinka má svý mouchy
[I miss having my prima flies]

01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:25,322
Her brain's a bit betwixt
a váhá, koho chtít!
[and hesitates, who want!]

01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,799
Get the fiance out of the way
Zbav se rychle toho snoubence,
[Get rid of it quickly fiance,]

01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,121
And the whole thing will be fixed
ať je všechno, jak má být!
[whether everything is as it should be!]

01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,959
We're not saying you can change him
Každý se tak dlouho hledá,
[Everyone is looking for so long,]

01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,049
'Cause people don't really change
však nezmění duši svou.
[but changed his soul.]

01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,679
We're only saying that love's a force
Jen láska změní tě nakonec,
[Only love will change you in the end,]

01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:41,039
That's powerful and strange
v ní mocná kouzla jsou!
[it is powerful spells!]

01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:43,279
People make bad choices
Lidi špatně rozhodnou se,
[People choose the wrong,]

01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,687
If they're mad or scared or stressed
když je žene spěch.
[when it is driven rush.]

01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,799
But throw a little love their way
Však lásce pravé podlehnou.
[But true love succumb.]

01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,159
Throw a little love their way
Lásce pravé podlehnou.
[True love succumb.]

01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,283
And you'll bring out their best
Jen ta jim bere dech!
[Only that it takes your breath away!]

01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,688
True love brings out the best
Ten cit je lékem všech.
[That sentiment is the cure all.]

01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,367
Everyone's a bit of a fixer-upper
Nikdo není génius, má svý mouchy,
[Nobody's genius has his flies,]

01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,319
That's what it's all about
o tom to vlastně je!
[That's what it is!]

01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,399
Father! Sister! Brother!
Táta! Sestra! Bráška!
[Dad! Nurse! Brother!]

01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:04,199
We need each other to raise us up
Tak žijem spolu,
[So we live together]

01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,561
And round us out
než z kukly každý vylétne!
[pupae than anyone comes out!]

01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,959
Everyone's a bit of a fixer-upper
Nikdo není génius, má svý mouchy,
[Nobody's genius has his flies,]

01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:11,479
But when push comes to shove
a když jde za láskou,
[and when it comes to love,]

01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:12,759
The only fixer-upper fixer
tak to pak muška mušku napravuje,
[it then corrects bead front sight,]

01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:13,839
That can fix a fixer-upper is...
napravuje, až tu je...
[corrects when there is...]

01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:17,279
True, true
Ta pravá,
[The right,]

01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:18,399
True
Pravá...
[Right...]

01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,479
Love!
...láska!
[... Love!]

01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:20,839
Love, love, love
Ta láska,
[The love]

01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:22,839
Love! True love
ta láska...
[the love...]

01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:23,999
True
...pravá.
[... right.]

01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,199
Do you, Anna, take Kristoff to be your trollfully wedded...
Bereš si, Anno, zde Kristoffa za svého právoplatného...
[Do you, Anna, here Kristoff be your lawful wedded...]

01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,159
Wait, what? - You're getting married.
Cože? - Oddáváme vás.
[What? - We indulge you.]

01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,319
Love!
Láska!
[Love!]

01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,601
Anna?
Anno?
[Anna?]

01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:34,806
She's as cold as ice.
Je studená jak led.
[It's cold as ice.]

01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:39,170
There is strange magic here.
To je tou prapodivnou magií.
[This is the most bizarre magic.]

01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:42,563
Granpabbie. - Come, come. Bring her here to me.
Pratrolle. - Honem, přiveď ji ke mně.
[Pratrolle. - Come on, bring it to me.]

01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:46,725
Anna, your life is in danger.
Anno, tvůj život je v nebezpečí.
[Anna, your life is in danger.]

01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:50,324
There is ice in your heart put there by your sister.
Ve tvém srdci je mráz, jež zasela tvá sestra.
[In your heart is cold, which sowed your sister.]

01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:55,648
If not removed, to solid ice will you freeze, forever.
Pokud nebude odstraněn, pak se navždycky proměníš v kus ledu.
[If not corrected, you will forever turn into ice.]

01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,239
What? No.
Cože? Ne.
[What? No.]

01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,679
But you can remove it, right?
Ale ty ho můžeš odstranit, že?
[But you can remove it, right?]

01:08:58,680 --> 01:08:59,879
I cannot
To nemohu.
[I can not.]

01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,889
I'm sorry, Kristoff.
Odpusť, Kristoffe.
[Forgive me, Kristoff.]

01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,399
If it was her head, that would be easy.
Kdyby šlo o hlavu, bylo by to snadné.
[If it was a head, it would be easy.]

01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:09,401
But only an act of true love can thaw a frozen heart.
Ale ledové srdce může rozehřát jen projev pravé lásky.
[But the heart can melt ice only a manifestation of true love.]

01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,679
An act of true love?
Projev pravé lásky?
[Manifestation of true love?]

01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:14,167
A true love's kiss, perhaps?
Třeba vřelý polibek.
[Perhaps a warm kiss.]

01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:20,279
(Something's wrong. Are you all right?)

01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,879
Anna, we've got to get you back to Hans.
Anno, pomoct ti může jen Hans.
[Annie, it can only help Hans.]

01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:23,999
Hans.
Hans.
[Hans.]

01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,201
Pull us out, Sven.
Vytáhni nás, Svene.
[Pull us, Sven.]

01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,359
Olaf, come on!
Olafe, poběž!
[Olaf, Come on!]

01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:31,085
I'm coming!
Již kvačím!
[Already kvačím!]

01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,363
Let's go kiss Hans!
Jedeme políbit Hanse!
[We're going to kiss Hans!]

01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,484
Who is this Hans?
Kdo je ten Hans?
[Who is this Hans?]

01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,489
We are here to find Princess Anna.
Přijeli jsme sem najít princeznu Annu.
[We came here to find a princess Anna.]

01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:51,442
Be on guard, but no harm is to come to the queen.
Buďte bdělí, ale královně neubližujte.
[Be vigilant, but do not hurt the queen.]

01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:53,879
Do you understand?
Je to všem jasné?
[Is it all clear?]

01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:55,880
Yes, Your Grace.

01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,491
The queen.
Královna!
[Queen!]

01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,568
Go, go! Come on!
Honem!
[Hurry!]

01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:29,887
There!
Rychle!
[Hurry!]

01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,567
Up there!
Tamhle je!
[There it is!]

01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,325
Come on!
Poběž!
[Come on!]

01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,081
We got her.
Máme ji.
[We have it.]

01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,920
No. Please.
Ne. Prosím.
[No. Please.]

01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,530
Go around. Toss it.
Jdi z druhé strany!
[Go to the other side!]

01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,886
Stay away!
Jděte pryč!
[Go away!]

01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,326
Look out!
Pozor!
[Beware!]

01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,839
Fire! Fire!
Střílej!
[Shoot!]

01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,246
Get her!
Chyť ji!
[Catch her!]

01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,321
Ah!

01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,926
Come on!
Dělejte!
[Come on!]

01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,007
Grab his arm.

01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,441
Aim...

01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,239
This way, this way!

01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:48,441
Whoa!

01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:51,847
Queen Elsa!
Královno Elso!
[Queen Elso!]

01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,761
Don't be the monster they fear you are.
Nebuďte monstrem, kterého se všichni bojí!
[Do not be a monster, whom everyone is afraid!]

01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,927
Oh, no. What have... What have I done?
Ach ne. Co jsem to udělala?
[Oh, do not. What have I done?]

01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,491
Why did you bring me here?
Proč jsi mě sem přivezl?
[Why did you bring me here?]

01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,439
I couldn't just let them kill you.
Nemohl jsem je nechat tě zabít.
[I could not let them kill you.]

01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,769
But I'm a danger to Arendelle. Get Anna.
Ale já jsem pro Arendelle nebezpečná. Přiveď Annu.
[But I have to Arendelle dangerous. Bring Anna.]

01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,199
Anna has not returned.
Anna se nevrátila.
[Anna did not return.]

01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,048
If you would just stop the winter.
Mohla bys zastavit tu zimu?
[Can you stop this winter?]

01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,846
Bring back summer, please.
Přivolej zpátky léto, prosím.
[Summon summer back, please.]

01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,645
Don't you see?
Copak to nechápeš?
[Do not you understand?]

01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,280
I can't.
Nevím jak.
[I do not know how.]

01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:18,281
You have to tell them to let me go.
Nezbývá ti než mě pustit.
[I have no choice but to let me go.]

01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,889
I will do what I can.
Udělám, co budu moct.
[I'll do what I can.]

01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:46,999
Just hang in there.
Ještě vydrž.
[Do not hold on.]

01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,361
Come on, buddy, faster!
Svene, přidej!
[Sven, add it!]

01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,359
Oh, boy!
Ty bláho!
[Wow!]

01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,562
Whoa! I'll meet you guys at the castle!
Uvidíme se všichni v zámku!
[I'll see you all in the castle!]

01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:58,999
Stay out of sight, Olaf.
Ať tě nikdo nevidí, Olafe!
[Let no one sees you, Olaf!]

01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,725
I will!
Jasný!
[Bright!]

01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:04,161
Hello! - It's alive!
Nazdar! - Obluda!
[Hi! - Monster!]

01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,725
It's Princess Anna!
To je princezna Anna!
[This is Princess Anne!]

01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,969
Are you gonna be okay?
Obejdeš se bez těch saní?
[Obejdeš without the slide?]

01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,679
Don't worry about me.
O mě se neboj.
[Do not worry about me.]

01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:30,519
Anna!
Anno!
[Anna!]

01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,439
You had us worried sick. My Lady.
Měli jsme o vás hrozný strach. Má paní.
[We had so worried about you. My lady.]

01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:35,439
Get her warm. And find Prince Hans, immediately.
Musí do tepla. A najděte prince Hanse. Okamžitě!
[They have to heat. And find Prince Hans. Immediately!]

01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,051
We will. Thank you.
Ano. Díky.
[Yes. Thanks.]

01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,731
Make sure she's safe.
Dejte na ni pozor.
[Give her attention.]

01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,679
Oh, you poor girl, you're freezing.
Chudinko malá, jste jak kus ledu.
[Poor little, you as a piece of ice.]

01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:44,089
Oh, let's get you inside now and get you warm.

01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:59,399
I'm going back out to look for Princess Anna.
Musím najít princeznu Annu.
[I must find the Princess Anne.]

01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,250
You cannot risk going out there again.
Další výprava by byla velice riskantní.
[Another expedition would have been very risky.]

01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:02,599
If anything happens to her...
Kdyby se jí něco stalo...
[If anything happened to her...]

01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,564
If anything happens to the princess,
Kdyby se princezně něco stalo,
[Had something happened to the Princess,]

01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:07,127
you are all Arendelle has left.
má Arendelle už jenom vás.
[Arendelle has been just you.]

01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:10,519
He's in here.
Tady je.
[Here is.]

01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:11,639
Prince Hans.
Princi Hansi!
[Hansi prince!]

01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,079
Anna.
Anno!
[Anna!]

01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,199
You're so cold.
Jsi celá zmrzlá.
[You're all frozen.]

01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,439
Hans, you have to kiss me. - What?
Hansi, musíš mě políbit. - Cože?
[Hans, you have to kiss me. - What?]

01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,159
Now! Now! - Slow down.
Hned. - Nač ten spěch?
[Right. - What's the rush?]

01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:19,089
We'll give you two some privacy.
Dopřejeme vám trochu soukromí.
[We bring you a little privacy.]

01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,039
What happened out there?
Co se tam venku stalo?
[What happened out there?]

01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,129
Elsa struck me with her powers.
Elsa mě zasáhla svou magií.
[Elsa hit me with his magic.]

01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,679
You said she'd never hurt you.
Říkalas, že ti neublíží.
[You said that you hurt.]

01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:25,759
I was wrong.
Mýlila jsem se.
[I was wrong.]

01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,325
Anna.
Anno!
[Anna!]

01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,690
She froze my heart,
Zmrazila mé srdce
[I froze my heart]

01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:34,366
and only an act of true love can save me.
a zachránit mě může jen opravdová láska.
[and save me the only true love.]

01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,804
A true love's kiss.
Polibek z pravé lásky.
[Kiss of true love.]

01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:49,160
Oh, Anna.
Anno.
[Anno.]

01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:53,559
If only there was someone out there who loved you.
Kéž by byl někdo, kdo by tě opravdu miloval.
[I wish there was someone who really loves you.]

01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:55,000
What?
Cože?
[What?]

01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,284
You said you did.
Říkals, že jsi to ty.
[You said it was you.]

01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:04,199
As thirteenth in line in my own kingdom,
Jako třináctý následník v pořadí jsem neměl...
[Thirteenth successor in the order I did not...]

01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,479
I didn't stand a chance.
...žádnou šanci kralovat.
[... no chance to reign.]

01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:09,239
I knew I would have to marry into the throne somewhere.
Věděl jsem, že se musím někde k trůnu přiženit.
[I knew that I needed somewhere to the throne to marry.]

01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,805
What... What are you talking about?
O čem to mluvíš?
[What are you talking about?]

01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,767
As heir, Elsa was preferable, of course.
Samozřejmě že by mi spíš vyhovovala Elsa,
[Of course I would rather meet Elsa,]

01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,839
But no one was getting anywhere with her.
jenže na ní si každý vylámal zuby.
[but on her every withstood.]

01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:16,919
But you...
Ale ty...
[But you...]

01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,439
You were so desperate for love,
...jsi tolik toužila po lásce,
[... you are so longing for love,]

01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:21,371
you were willing to marry me just like that.
že sis mě vzala hned, jenom tak.
[that you married me now, just like that.]

01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,639
I figured after we married,
Napadlo mě, že až se vezmeme,
[It occurred to me that when we get married,]

01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,799
I would have to stage a little accident for Elsa.
bude se muset Else stát malá nehoda.
[Else it would have become a little accident.]

01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,048
Hans! No. Stop.
Hansi! Přestaň.
[Hansi! Stop.]

01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:31,159
But then, she doomed herself,
Ale pak se odepsala sama
[But then she wrote back]

01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:33,119
and you were dumb enough to go after her.
a tys byla tak hloupá, že jsi za ní běžela.
[and you were so stupid that you ran after her.]

01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,239
Please.
Prosím.
[Please.]

01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:36,920
All that's left now is to kill Elsa,
Jediné, co mi zbývá, je zabít Elsu
[The only thing I have left is to kill Elsa]

01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:38,971
and bring back summer.
a přivolat zpět léto.
[and summon back the summer.]

01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,439
You're no match for Elsa.
Ty se Else nikdy nevyrovnáš.
[You never Else nevyrovnáš.]

01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,847
No, you're no match for Elsa.
Ne, ty se Else nevyrovnáš.
[No, I'm Else nevyrovnáš.]

01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:45,681
I, on the other hand,
Víš, co teď jsem?
[You know what I am?]

01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:50,729
am the hero who is going to save Arendelle from destruction.
Jsem hrdina, který zachrání Arendelle před zničením.
[I am a hero who saves Arendelle from destruction.]

01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,011
You won't get away with this.
Tohle ti neprojde.
[That it will not pass.]

01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,607
Oh...

01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,811
I already have.
Už mi to prošlo.
[Have I got away with it.]

01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,324
Please, somebody, help.
Prosím, pomozte mi někdo.
[Please, somebody help me.]

01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,123

Prosím. Prosím.
[Please. Please.]

01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,999
It's getting colder by the minute.
S každou minutou je chladněji.

If we don't do something soon, we'll all freeze to death.
Jestli něco neuděláme, všichni tu umrzneme.

She was killed...
Byla zavražděna.

01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:36,327
No!
Ne!
[No!]

01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,681
Her own sister.
Vlastní sestrou?
[Own sister?]

01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,967
At least we got to say our marriage vows
Ale stačili jsme si dát manželský slib,

01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,282
before she died in my arms.
než mi zemřela v náručí.
[before she died in my arms.]

There can be no doubt now.
Už není pochyb o tom,

Queen Elsa is a monster,

Arendelle looks to you.
Arendelle k vám vzhlíží.
[Arendelle looks up to you.]

01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,719
With a heavy heart,
S těžkým srdcem...
[With a heavy heart...]

01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:03,891
I charge Queen Elsa of Arendelle with treason.
...obviňuji královnu Elsu Arendellskou z velezrady.

Move quickly. Careful!

It won't open! It's frozen shut.
Nejdou otevřít!
[Will not open!]

01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:27,686
Put your back into it!
Jsou přimrzlé.
[They're frozen.]

01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:29,279
Come on! Push!

01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:56,559
What is it, buddy?
Copak je, Svene?
[What is it, Sven?]

01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,205
Hey, watch it.
Pozor!
[Beware!]

01:18:58,560 --> 01:18:59,761
What's wrong with you?
Co to do tebe vjelo?

I don't understand you when you talk like that.
Nerozumím, když tak huhláš.

We're not going back.
Tam se nevrátíme.

She's with her true love.
Je se svou pravou láskou.
[It is her true love.]

01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:22,921
What the...
Co to...
[What the...]

01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:26,841
Anna!
Anno!
[Anna!]

01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,685
Come on! Come on, boy.

Anna!
Anno!
[Anna!]

01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:02,680
Oh, no.
Ne.
[No.]

01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,081
Olaf?
Olaf?
[Olaf?]

01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:18,482
Olaf. Get away from there.
Olafe, uteč odtamtud!
[Olaf, get out there!]

01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,161

So, this is heat.
Tak tohle je horko.

Ooh! But don't touch it.

So, where's Hans? What happened to your kiss?
Kde je Hans? Neměl tě políbit?
[Where is Hans? He did not kiss you?]

01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:41,806
I was wrong about him. It wasn't true love.
Já se v něm zmýlila. On mě nemiluje.
[I do it wrong. He loves me not.]

01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,725
But we ran all the way here.
Vždyť jsme za ním běželi.
[But we ran behind him.]

01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,239
Please, Olaf, you can't stay here. You'll melt.
Prosím, Olafe, tady nemůžeš zůstat. Roztaješ.
[Please, Olaf, you can not stay here. Roztaješ.]

01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:48,359
I am not leaving here until
Neodejdu, dokud nepřijdeme
[I'm not leaving until we come]

01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:51,131
we find some other act of true love to save you.
na jiný projev pravé lásky.
[on another manifestation of true love.]

01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,369
Do you happen to have any ideas?
Měla bys nějaký nápad?
[You should have an idea?]

01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:55,410
I don't even know what love is.
Vždyť ani nevím, co to láska je.
[I do not even know what love is.]

01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,484
That's okay, I do.
To neva. Já jo.
[Never mind. I do.]

01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,285
Love is
Láska je,
[Love is,]

01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:02,647
putting someone else's needs before yours.
když myslíš na druhého víc než na sebe.
[when you think of other more than themselves.]

01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:07,211
Like, you know, how Kristoff brought you back here to Hans and left you forever.
Jako když tě Kristoff dovezl sem za Hansem a pak tě navždy opustil.
[Like when you Kristoff brought here as Hans and then I passed away.]

01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:12,529
Kristoff loves me?
Kristoff mě miluje?
[Kristoff loves me?]

01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:17,607
Wow, you really don't know anything about love, do you?
Páni. Ty vážně nevíš o lásce vůbec nic, že ne?
[Wow. You really do not know anything about love, do you?]

01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:19,924
Olaf, you're melting.
Olafe, rozpouštíš se.
[Olaf, melt it.]

01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,402
Some people are worth melting for.
Někteří lidé za oběti stojí.
[Some people stand behind the victims.]

01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,642
Just maybe not right this second.
Ale možná to nemusí být hned.
[But it may not be right.]

01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,286
Don't worry, I've got it.
Neboj, hned to zavřu.
[Do not worry, once it closes.]

01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,923
We're gonna get through... Oh, wait.
Nějak se z toho spolu... Počkat.
[Somehow it together... Wait.]

01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,690
Hang on, I'm getting something.

01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:43,159
It's Kristoff and Sven!

01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:44,566
They're coming back this way.
A vrací se k nám!
[And coming back to us!]

01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,361
They... They are?
Opravdu?
[Really?]

01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:49,160
Wow! He's really moving fast.
Páni. Jsou rychlí jako blesk.
[Wow. They are fast as lightning.]

01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,639
I guess I was wrong.
Asi jsem se mýlil.
[I guess I was wrong.]

01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:53,207
I guess Kristoff doesn't love you enough to leave you behind.
Kristoff tě asi nemiluje tak, aby tě opustil.
[Kristoff probably loves you so that you left.]

01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,839
Help me up, Olaf. Please.
Pomoz mi, Olafe. Prosím.
[Help me, Olaf. Please.]

01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:58,999
No, no, no! You need to stay by the fire and keep warm.
Ne! Musíš zůstat u ohně a hřát se.
[No! You have to stay by the fire and get warm.]

01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,759
I need to get to Kristoff.
Ale já musím za Kristoffem.
[But I have for Kristoff.]

01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:02,041
Why?
Proč?
[Why?]

01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:04,959
Oh, I know why!
Já už vím proč.
[I already know why.]

01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,159
There's your act of true love right there!
To je ten projev pravé lásky.
[This is the manifestation of true love.]

01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:11,159
Riding across the fjords like a valiant, pungent reindeer king!
Jede za tebou na smradlavém sobovi jako rytíř.
[He goes behind you stinking reindeer as a knight.]

01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:12,646
Come on!
Jdeme!
[Come on!]

01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:16,519

To je do nebe volající.
[This is blatant.]

01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:57,479
I am a victim of fear. I've been traumatized.
Jsem obětí strachu, mám traumata.
[I am a victim of fear, I traumas.]

01:29:57,480 --> 01:29:59,364
Ah! My neck hurts.
Mám ústřel.
[I have lumbago.]

01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:03,039
Is there a doctor that I could see?
Potřebuji doktora, jste snad slepí?
[I need a doctor, are you blind?]

01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:05,439
And I demand to see the queen!
Žádám slyšení u královny!
[I request an audience with the Queen!]

01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,642
Oh. I have a message from the queen.
Mám pro vás od královny vzkaz.
[I have a message from the Queen.]

01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,919
"Arendelle will henceforth and forever
Arendelle tímto navždy ukončuje...
[Arendelle hereby terminated forever...]

01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:14,045
"no longer do business of any sort with Weaseltown."
...veškeré obchodní styky s vévodou z Kradákova.
[... all its dealings with the Duke of Kradákova.]

01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,239
"Weselton."
Kravákova.
[Kravákova.]

01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:16,799
It's Weselton!
Je to Kravákov!
[It Kravákov!]

01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:17,919
Come on, come on, come on!
Poběž, poběž, poběž!
[Come on, Come on, Come on!]

01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,399
Okay, okay, here I come.
Dobře. Už běžím.
[Okay. I'm coming.]

01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,489
Pole! - Whoops! Sorry.
Lampa. - Hopla. Pardon.
[Lamp. - Whoops. Sorry.]

01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:24,211
Okay, Okay.
Tak jo.
[So yeah.]

01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:26,044
Here we are. Oh!
Jdeme na to.
[Here we go.]

01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:30,363
I owe you a sled.
Tvé nové sáně.
[Your new sled.]

01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:35,204
Are you serious? - Yes!
To myslíš vážně? - Jo!
[Are you serious? - Yeah!]

01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:36,999
And it's the latest model.
Je to nejnovější model.
[It's the latest model.]

01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,599
No, I can't accept this.
To nemůžu přijmout.
[I can not accept.]

01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:41,565
You have to. No returns. No exchanges. Queen's orders.
Musíš. Koukej mlčet. Ani slovo. Rozkaz královny.
[You have to. Look silent. Not a word. Queen orders.]

01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:45,521
She's named you the Official Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer.
Oficiálně tě jmenovala arendellským královským ledařem.
[He officially named arendellským royal iceman.]

01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,519
What? That's not a thing. - Oh, sure it is.
Cože? Nic takového není. - Jasně že je.
[What? Nothing like this. - Sure it is.]

01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:51,039
And it even has a cup holder. Do you like it?
Je tam i držáček na kelímky. Líbí se ti?
[There is also the tab on the cups. Do you like her?]

01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:53,359
Like it? I love it!
Líbí? Jsem nadšený!
[Like it? I'm excited!]

01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,439
Whoa.

01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:56,290
I could kiss you!
Dám ti pusu.
[I'll give you a kiss.]

01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,879
I could. I mean, I'd like to. I'd...
Rád bych... chci říct, moc chci.
[I would like... I mean, I want too.]

01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:01,079
May I? We me. I mean, may we?
Můžu? Můžeme... chci říct, smím to?
[Can I? I... I mean, can I do it?]

01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:02,327
Wait, what?
Cože?
[What?]

01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:04,566
We may.
Můžeme.
[We can.]

01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:09,926
Summer!
Léto!
[Summer!]

01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,799
Ooh...

01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,879
Hello.
Ahoj.
[Hey.]

01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:33,239
Are you ready?
Můžu začít?
[Can I start?]

01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:41,282
Ice!

01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:55,125
Swing me.
Postrč mě!
[Nudge me!]

01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,804
Ooh...

01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,759
I like the open gates.
Ty otevřené brány se mi líbí.
[They opened the gate I like.]

01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:02,122
We are never closing them again.
Už nikdy je nezavřeme.
[We never close.]

01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:07,127
Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful, but you know I don't skate.
Elso, jsou krásné, ale víš, že neumím bruslit.
[Elso are nice, but you know I can not skate.]

01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:08,731
Come on! You can do it!
Jen pojď, to zvládneš.
[Come on, do it.]

01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,359
Look out. Reindeer coming through.
Pozor! Místo pro soba.
[Beware! Instead of reindeer.]

01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,119
I got it, I got it. I don't got it, I don't got it.
Jde mi to, jde mi to. Nejde mi to, nejde mi to!
[It comes to me, comes to me. It's not me, not me!]

01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:14,199
Hey, guys!
Holky!
[Girls!]

01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:15,519
That's it, Olaf.
Bezva, Olafe.
[Great, Olaf.]

01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:18,839
Glide and pivot. And glide and pivot.
Skluz a odraz. Skluz a odraz.
[Slippage and reflection. Slippage and reflection.]
