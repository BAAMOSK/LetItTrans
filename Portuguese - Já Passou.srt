00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,
A neve cobre a montanha esta noite,
The snow covers the mountain tonight,

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
not a footprint to be seen
Mas os passos são só meus.
But the only footsteps are mine.

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,500
A kingdom of isolation,
Comigo só há solidão,
There is only the loneliness with me,

00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
and it looks like I'm the queen
Sou rainha destes céus.
I'm the queen of these heavens.

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Cá dentro a tempestade que estou a sentir
This storm that I am feeling inside

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,000
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried
Não a controlei, deixei-a sair.
I didn't control it, I let it out.

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Não vão entrar, não podem ver!
They won't come in, they cannot see!

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,500
Be the good girl you always had to be
Sê a menina que tu tens de ser!
Be the girl you have to be!

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Esconder, conter, ou saberão.
Conceal, contain, or they will know.

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, now they know!
Mas foi em vão!
But it was in vain!

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let it go, let it go!
Já passou, já passou!
It's OK now, it's OK now!

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Can't hold it back any more!
Não vivo mais com temor.
I don't live in fear any more.

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Let it go, let it go!
Já passou, já passou!
It's OK now, it's OK now!

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,000
Turn away and slam the door!
Fecha a porta, por favor!
Please close the door!

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,500
I don't care what they're going to say
Tanto faz o que vão dizer
I don't care what they're going to say

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,000
Let the storm rage on
Venha a tempestade...
A storm comes...

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The cold never bothered me anyway.
O frio nunca me fará estremecer.
The cold will never make me shiver.

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,500
It's funny how some distance
Eu vejo que a distância
I can see some distance

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,000
Makes everything seem small
vai tudo suavizar.
will make everything seem softer.

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,000
And the fears that once controlled me
E os medos de outros tempos
And that my old fears

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Can't get to me at all!
não me vão apanhar!
won't be able to get to me!

00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,000
It's time to see what I can do
Ser livre assim é mesmo bom!
Being free like this is really good!

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,500
To test the limits and break through
Ver os limites deste dom.
To test the limits of this gift.

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,500
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
Sem regras sou feliz enfim!
Without rules I'm happy at last!

00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
I'm free!
Sou sim!
Yes I am!

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,500
Let it go, let it go!
Já passou, já passou!
It's OK now, it's OK now!

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
I am one with the wind and sky
Este é mesmo o meu lugar.
This is where I belong.

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,000
Let it go, let it go!
Já passou, já passou!
It's OK now, it's OK now!

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You'll never see me cry
Não irei mais chorar.
I won't cry any more.

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,500
Here I stand, and here I'll stay,
Estou aqui e vou ficar,
Here I am, and here I'll stay,

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,000
Let the storm rage on...
Venha a tempestade...
A storm comes...

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,000
My power flurries through the air and to the ground
O meu poder agita o ar que entra no chão
My power stirs the air that enters the ground

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:46,000
My soul is spiralling in frozen fractals all around
A minha alma brilha em espirais até mais não
My soul shines in infinite spirals

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,000
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
Um pensamento tudo irá cristalizar
A thought will crystallize everything

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I'm never going back
O que passou, passou.
What has passed, has passed.

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,500
The past is in the past!
Para trás não vou olhar!
I'm not looking back!

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Let it go, let it go!
Já passou, já passou!
It's OK now, it's OK now!

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Com o amanhã me vou erguer.
I will rise with tomorrow.

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,000
Let it go, let it go!
Já passou, já passou!
It's OK now, it's OK now!

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,500
That perfect girl is gone
Menina não vou ser.
I won't be a little girl any more.

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,500
Here I stand in the light of day
Este dia está a nascer
The dawn is coming

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,000
Let the storm rage on!
Venha a tempestade!
A storm comes!

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,500
The cold never bothered me anyway.
O frio nunca me fará estremecer.
The cold will never make me shiver.
